Using a new feature in Azure, now you can easily configure to trigger an Azure Automation Runbook when an Alert is trigger on an Azure Virtual Machine. To leverage this feature all you need to do is link the alert on Azure VM to an already existing Azure Automation Runbook.

 > Note: This feature is supported only for the V2 Virtual Machines, i.e. the VMs created using ARM portal.
