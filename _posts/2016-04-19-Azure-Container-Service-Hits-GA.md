Azure Container Service has finally hit General Availability today. 

If you don't know already, it is the "container hosting solution" which is optimized for Microsoft's Azure cloud.
All the tools that you may be familiar with when working with a Container Service should work like Apache Mesos or Docker Swarm. It only uses open source components in the orchestration layers to give you portability of full applications.
