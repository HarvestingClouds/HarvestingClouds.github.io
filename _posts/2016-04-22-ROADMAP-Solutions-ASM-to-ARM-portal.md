Right now the scripts to help with "Azure Service Management or ASM portal (older)" to "Azure Resource Manager or ARM portal (newer)" are limited to only a set of scripts provided by Microsoft. The same can be found on [GitHub on ASM2ARM page.](https://github.com/fullscale180/asm2arm){:target="_blank"}

Microsoft has promised that they are committed to make the migration more easier from ASM to ARM portal. Various solutions are already in the pipeline for this.
Below are the details and roadmap for the tentative timelines for these solutions.
