Please note that this option is not compatible with applications using partition switching and index hints. Dropping unused indexes is not supported for Premium and Business Critical service tiers.   <\/li>\n<li>Parameterize queries recommendations (preview) - Recommends forced parameterization in cases when you have one or more queries that are constantly being recompiled but end up with the same query execution plan.  <\/li>\n<li>Fix schema issues recommendations (preview) - Recommendations for schema correction appear when the SQL Database service notices an anomaly in the number of scheme-related SQL errors that are happening on your SQL database. Microsoft is currently deprecating the &quot;Fix schema issue&quot; recommendations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Automatic Tuning<\/h3>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845063775e71a60998da5.png\" alt=\"Automatic Tuning\">\n<p>Azure SQL Database automatic tuning provides peak performance and stable workloads through continuous performance tuning based on AI and machine learning.\nAutomatic tuning is a fully managed intelligent performance service that uses built-in intelligence to continuously monitor queries executed on a database, and it automatically improves their performance. This is achieved by dynamically adapting the database to the changing workloads and applying tuning recommendations. Automatic tuning learns horizontally from all databases on Azure through AI and it dynamically improves its tuning actions. The longer a database runs with automatic tuning on, the better it performs.\nAzure SQL Database automatic tuning might be one of the most important features that you can enable to provide stable and peak performing database workloads.<\/p>\n<p>What can automatic tuning do for you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automated performance tuning of Azure SQL databases<\/li>\n<li>Automated verification of performance gains<\/li>\n<li>Automated rollback and self-correction<\/li>\n<li>Tuning history<\/li>\n<li>Tuning action T-SQL scripts for manual deployments<\/li>\n<li>Proactive workload performance monitoring<\/li>\n<li>Scale-out capability on hundreds of thousands of databases<\/li>\n<li>The positive impact to DevOps resources and the total cost of ownership<\/li>\n<\/ul>",

This is a fully managed, centralized backup service simplifying the management of your backups for your Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes, your databases (Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) or Amazon DynamoDB), AWS Storage Gateway and your Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) filesystems. <\/p>\n<h3>Configuring Backup Plans<\/h3>\n<p>To be able to use AWS Backup you need Backup Plans configured and created. <\/p>\n<p>Let's first navigate to the service by going to <strong>Services<\/strong> and then &quot;<strong>AWS Backup<\/strong>&quot; service under the Storage category.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843315955e6efb4bd033b.png\" alt=\"AWS Backup service navigation\">\n<p>When you launch this service for the very first time, you are provided with loads of information regarding the service. The first thing that you need to do is to create a <strong>Backup Plan<\/strong>. Click on the button to &quot;<strong><em>Create Backup plan<\/em><\/strong>&quot;.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843316025e6efb524ea63.png\" alt=\"Creating Backup plan\">\n<p>You can either start from an existing plan (to copy all it's settings) or build a new plan. If you don't have anything configured then you will have to select the option to Build a new plan. Provide a name for the plan and scroll down.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843316225e6efb66b1ab8.png\" alt=\"Building a new plan\">\n<p>Next, provide the Backup rule configurations. With every backup plan, you can have multiple backup rules. Basically, these define when a backup is taken, how often it is taken, when does this backup expires and so on. You start by specifying a name for the rule. Then you specify a Schedule for the backup. The options include Daily, Weekly, Monthly etc. You can also customize the backup window, i.e. at what hour of the day the backup is taken.<\/p>\n<p>Under <strong>Lifecycle<\/strong>, you define when the backup should transition to Cold storage and when it should expire. You also select a Vault for the backup. This is the vault resource where the recovery points created by the Backup service are organized. <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843316275e6efb6be8850.png\" alt=\"Backup rule configuration\">\n<p>Next, you can copy the backup to multiple regions. In this way you get redundancy. If the backup primary region goes down, you can use the copy from a different region to restore.<\/p>\n<p>Here you also specify the Tags to add to a backup plan to organize and categorize this in a better way. <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843316355e6efb731b88c.png\" alt=\"Copy to region and tags settings\">\n<p>Click on the &quot;<strong>Create plan<\/strong>&quot; button once done. As you can see from the two notes above, once the plan is created, you can assign resources to this backup plan. We want to add our EC2 instance to this plan. We will do this in the next blog post. <\/p>\n<p>For more information please check this link:\n<a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/backup\/?nc2=h_ql_prod_st_bu\" target=\"_blank\">AWS Backup<\/a><\/p>",

If you know one, it is very easy to translate the information to another platform. The essential part is to look out for the quirks of each platform and note how these differ from each other. Let's dive in.<\/p>\n<p>You can create the VM resource in one of the two ways. Either by navigating to &quot;<em>Create a resource<\/em>&quot; and then finding the VM you want to build. <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843034905e6e8d82e484b.png\" alt=\"1 Create a resource\">\n<p>Or you can navigate to the VMs section and then click on the <strong>Add<\/strong> button to build the VM.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843034975e6e8d89a4c41.png\" alt=\"2 Add a VM\">\n<p>You are presented with the &quot;Create a virtual machine&quot; wizard. Here you ensure that the subscription and the resource group is correct. <strong>Subscription<\/strong> is how to buy and use Azure. You have different plans like &quot;Pay as you go&quot; when subscribing to Azure. <strong>Resource Groups<\/strong> are nothing but a logical grouping of resources in Azure. <\/p>\n<p>You also provide the Instance details like the name of the VM, the region where the VM will be deployed, any redundancy options etc.<\/p>\n<p>You select the VM image that you want to build e.g. Windows Server 2016 Datacenter. This is similar to selecting the AMI or Amazon machine image in AWS. The Size decides how many vCPUs and Memory in GiB is allocated to the VM. This is also how you will be billed per month for the VM. Note that you only pay when the VM is running. If the VM is in Stopped and Deallocated state then you are not charged for the Compute consumption of the VM. Then you are only charged for the storage component of the VM.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843035325e6e8dacf35ce.png\" alt=\"3_1 Creating a VM\">\n<p>When you scroll down, this is also where you provide the credentials to be used with the VM. You also configure allowed ports for the VM. E.g. RDP is opened here. You can tweak this further in the Networking section ahead.<\/p>\n<p>The biggest difference here is that, if you own a Windows license on-premises then you can leverage that to <strong>save up to 49%<\/strong> in Azure via Azure Hybrid Benefit.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843035705e6e8dd294530.png\" alt=\"3_1 Creating a VM\">\n<p>Next, you select the VM disks. Here based on your selection you get faster and slower IOPS. You can also add new or existing disks as data disks.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843035815e6e8ddde551f.png\" alt=\"4 VM Disks\">\n<p>In the networking section, you can select an existing Virtual network or create a new one. You can select subnets within that network or create a new one as well. Same goes for the Public IP. This is also where you can tweak the network security group.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843035995e6e8def01069.png\" alt=\"5 VM Networking\">\n<p>Under the management section, you can configure Monitoring options. You can also configure Auto-shutdown configurations on the VM as well.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843036465e6e8e1e54144.png\" alt=\"6 VM Management\">\n<p>Under Advanced settings, you can install Microsoft or Third party extensions like Chef, Puppet etc. You can also automate one time installations in your linux VMs via Cloud init. <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15843036705e6e8e36f01e4.png\" alt=\"7 Advanced settings\">\n<p>Next, you can assign Tags to categorize the resources. These come in very handy when creating billing reports.

			"body": "<p>In this post, we will look at how to create EC2 instances in Amazon Web Service (AWS). <\/p>\n<p>You start by selecting the option to create or launch the instances.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842968305e6e737ee3631.png\" alt=\"1 Creating Instances\">\n<p>In the Instance creation wizard, the breadcrumb at the top show you where in the wizard you are currently at. The first screen is to choose an image for the VM or EC2 instance. The image is called an <strong>Amazon machine image<\/strong> or <strong>AMI<\/strong>. You can also search for an AMI. Under the image name, you can view the details of the image. Make sure you select the right image. Click on the Select button once decided. <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842969145e6e73d2658a7.png\" alt=\"2 Chossing the Amazon Machine Image or AMI\">\n<p>Next, select the instance type. Here you are selecting the actual compute details i.e. the number of vCPUs and the Memory in GiB. You are billed as per the instance type you select.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842969265e6e73dee9670.png\" alt=\"3 Choosing the Instance Type\">\n<p>Next, you select various Instance details. This screen is very vast and makes your deployment very configurable. In this post we will not go into each of these settings. Here you can decide to create an Auto Scaling Group, request spot instances, add placement group, select domain join directory, decide shutdown behavior etc. One key setting that you select here is the <strong>Networking details<\/strong>. You select your VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) network and the subnet for the instance.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842971165e6e749cf1a37.png\" alt=\"4_1 Configuring Instance Details\">\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842971535e6e74c198196.png\" alt=\"4_2 Configuring Instance Details\">\n<p>Next, you configure the Storage details. You can tweak the default storage assigned and can also add more storage. Based on the IOPS requirements you select the Volume type. You can encrypt the storage as well.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842971705e6e74d26ab0e.png\" alt=\"5 Adding Storage\">\n<p>Next, you add tags to your instance and underlying volumes. <strong>Tags<\/strong> are a great way to categorize resources. Below is just an example of a couple of tags assigned to the instance and underlying volumes. <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842972035e6e74f3d9532.png\" alt=\"6 Adding Tags\">\n<p>Now you configure the firewall on the Instance via Security Groups. You can create a new one or select an existing one. This is where you decide what can connect to your instance and what can not. In the screenshot below the RDP connectivity on port 3389 is open. Please note that the Source of &quot;0.0.0.0\/0&quot; means that it is open for all internet. It is highly recommended that you change this setting to only your IP addresses from where you will connect. <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842972215e6e750563278.png\" alt=\"7 Configuring Security Group\">\n<p>Finally, you review the details. If you need to view the details in detail just expand that category. Click the Edit buttons on the right to edit that setting. Hit Launch to trigger the instance provisioning.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842972375e6e751597c65.png\" alt=\"8 Review details\">\n<p>Before the instance can be provisioned, you are prompted with a popup to select a key pair or create a new one. This is a Private and Public key pair that is used to authenticate. You download and keep the Private key. Note that you can only download the Private key at the time of creation. You will not be able to access it later.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842972555e6e7527c1a67.png\" alt=\"9 Creating or selecting Key Pair to connect to Instance\">\n<p>You can check the launch status on the next screen. <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842972725e6e75383a905.png\" alt=\"10 Checking Launch Status\">\n<p>Finally, you can view and check your instance. It will be listed in the list under the Instances section under EC2 service.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15842972895e6e7549a0a1c.png\" alt=\"11 Instance in the console\">\n<p>For more information, refer to the below links:\n<a href=\"https:\/\/aws.amazon.com\/ec2\/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)<\/a><\/p>",

E.g. you could stop the end users from using a password like &quot;test123&quot; or &quot;password1&quot; etc. You can add as many general passwords to ban. As a good practice, you should add your organization's name or any common internal password to this list with any variants you believe end users may use. The end goal is to try and make the password as much difficult and secure as possible. <\/p>\n<p>This feature also allows you to specify the thresholds to lock a user in case of failed sign-in attempts. It allows you to set the time for which the user will be locked out before they can try signing in again. <\/p>\n<p>This feature can be accessed by navigating to the Azure Active Directory and then selecting &quot;Authentication methods&quot; under the Security section.

			],
			"category": "Azure",
			"body": "<p>Navigating Azure Portal can become challenging. You want to navigate to different Azure Resources or Resource Groups or want to check a particular Service in Azure. Instead of going to &quot;All Services&quot; and searching for your resource, if you can save a little time by searching more efficiently, it can add up over time and make you more efficient as well. So here are few tips on how you can navigate with ease in Azure.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Pin\/Favorite most common Services and re-ordering them<\/h3>\n<p>For a recent project, I was working with Azure Route Table a lot. I was navigating to these multiple times and making a lot of changes. Instead of going to &quot;All Services&quot; and searching for Route Table service every time, you search for it only once and Star it to mark it as Favorite. It will start showing up in the Services list to the left under Favorites.  <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15513414255c779771e2940.png\" alt=\"Marking a Service as Favorite\">\n<p>Next, you want to re-order the Services under Favorites, so you don't have to scroll to navigate to most common services. You can do so by hovering the cursor on the service name under Favorites, and then click and drag on the ellipse (i.e. 3 dots to the right of the service name) as shown below. <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15513414435c7797839cd64.png\" alt=\"Re-ordering the service in Favorites\">\n<p>Now you will have the most commonly visited service at the tip of your hands. <\/p>\n<h3>2. Pin most common Resources to your dashboard<\/h3>\n<p>Another scenario I faced in one of the projects was that every time I logged in, I had to make some changes to a VM and connect to the same using it's dynamically assigned Public IP. That meant navigating to this VM, every day and starting the VM and connecting to it. I had to start the VM as auto-shutdown was configured on the VM to save cost. Instead of navigating to the Virtual Machines and then searching for the VM and then navigating to it, you can simply Pin the VM to your dashboard. Next time you open the portal, the VM will be right there on the Dashboard. <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15513414555c77978fbf2b8.png\" alt=\"Pinning a resource to a dashboard\">\n<p>You can similarly Pin other resources like SQL Databases, etc.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Searching for Resources, Resource Groups, Services and Documentation using the new Search bar<\/h3>\n<p>One of the cool features I stumbled upon is the new search bar in the Azure portal. It had made navigating Azure portal so much easier. You just start searching for the resource or Resource Group or Service name in the text box at the top of the portal. You don't even have to type the whole thing. Just start typing and the results will start popping up. Look for different sections in the suggestions box the pops up under the text box. Click on your desired resource or Resource Group or Service. <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15513414665c77979a37437.png\" alt=\"Navigating the smart way\">\n<p>One advantage of this search box is that you can not just search for resources or resource groups or services, you can also search for Marketplace solutions and Documentation. I have leveraged this feature to search for documentation a lot. You can't remember everything and you have to reference documentation every now and then. Instead of googling the documentation, you can quickly search for it, without leaving the Azure portal and access it. You don't have to worry about navigating away from the Azure portal. The documentation will open up in a separate tab automatically. <\/p>\n<p>I hope that these tips will help you increase your efficiency. Let us know which tip helped you and which you already knew about, in the comments below. <\/p>",

Instead of starting from scratch, you can bootstrap your automation via ARM Templates.<\/p>\n<h3>Reuse Existing<\/h3>\n<p>You can first search for your resources or scenarios in the Microsoft Quick Start templates. Note that these are sample templates from Microsoft and community members. These templates can be found here: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Azure\/azure-quickstart-templates\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Quickstart Templates<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>When you click on a template name you will see multiple files as shown below. Actual template file will always be named as &quot;<strong><em>azuredeploy.json<\/em><\/strong>&quot;. The related parameters file will be named as &quot;<strong><em>azuredeploy.parameters.json<\/em><\/strong>&quot;. All other files are optional and are the supporting files for the template.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15513749945c781a929e78b.png\" alt=\"Sample Template in Quickstart Repo on GitHub\">\n<p>You can download these files and edit them. You can fork them directly in GitHub and start editing in a source control environment, but your changes will be public (unless you change your repository to Private). If you do not want to make changes and want to directly deploy one of the template, simply click on the &quot;<strong>Deploy to Azure<\/strong>&quot; button. This will open Azure portal and you will need to sign into your subscription. Then the template deployment blade will open with the template information already populated. You will just need to select right Subscription, Resource Group and provide various parameters. <\/p>\n<p>It is really simple and saves you lot of time instead of authoring the template from scratch. Why re-invent the wheel. Reuse instead!<\/p>\n<h3>Generating template for new resource creation in Azure<\/h3>\n<p>If you are creating new resource from the Azure portal and you have to perform this same action multiple times, you should consider using an ARM Template. If you want to create an ARM Template for a resource for which you can't find a template, even then you can use Azure portal to bootstrap the template creation, rather than starting from scratch. <\/p>\n<p>Simple go ahead and start creating your resource from Azure portal. At the last screen, instead of actually creating the resource, look for a link with the name as &quot;<strong>Download a template for automation<\/strong>&quot;. This will open another blade which will show you the template. You can download the template from here. It will also include the related parameters file and a script to perform the deployment of your template. The below screenshot shows you the option for Storage Account creation.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15513748915c781a2b8fa9a.png\" alt=\"Option for Download a template for automation\">\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: This option will not be available for all resource types.

As such you will need to pull lots of reports based on this consumption and usage related csv file that you get from the EA portal i.e. at address: <a href=\"https:\/\/ea.azure.com\" target=\"_blank\"><a href=\"https:\/\/ea.azure.com\">https:\/\/ea.azure.com<\/a><\/a>. Tagging is one of the important components. But it comes as a composite JSON in one column. You will want to split this into multiple columns, with one column for each tag. <\/p>\n<p>The script sample in this blog performs exactly this parsing for you. You will need to tweak the script to include the tags as per your environment. <\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: The EA portal is only available to the EA customer. If you are not an EA customer, then if you try to login, you will get the following error:Invalid User: The account provided is not a valid user of the Microsoft Azure Enterprise Portal. Please sign in with a valid account. If you believe you have received this message in error, please contact Support.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h3>Sample Input EA Azure Billing CSV<\/h3>\n<p>The tags section in the CSV will look similar to below <strong>JSON format key-value pairs<\/strong> under the column for &quot;<strong>Tags<\/strong>&quot;:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{  \"ApplicationOwner\": \"aman@domain.com\",  \"BusinessUnit\": \"Infrastructure\",  \"ApplicationType\": \"Test\",  \"Department\": \"Infrastructure\"}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now as a requirement, you will want to split this to separate columns for the Tags for &quot;Application Owner&quot;, &quot;Business Unit&quot;, &quot;ApplicationType&quot; and &quot;Department&quot;. <\/p>\n<h3>How does the script parse this JSON<\/h3>\n<p>The script parses the JSON by splitting it into multiple values and then saving the new object as an output CSV. Right now these tag values are hard coded into the script and needs to be tweaked as per your requirements. Look out for the names of the variables and output member names with same name as that of the Tags mentioned above. These are the ones that you will need to alter. <\/p>\n<p>The script also takes into factor if the tag was added incorrectly with space in the name instead of pascal casing (i.e. name with no space between two words and first letter capital for each word).<\/p>\n<h3>Location of the Script<\/h3>\n<p>The script is located in the GitHub along with samples for Input and Output CSV files at this location: <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/HarvestingClouds\/PowerShellSamples\/tree\/master\/Scripts\/Format-EABillingUsageCsvForTags\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub location for Format Billing CSV Script<\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: An alternative to using the billing related csv file is to leverage <strong>PowerBI<\/strong> and build dashboards by consuming the EA related billing APIs which are available out of the box. These are in preview at the time of the writing of this blog. Parsing tags is still an issue with these. We will cover these in one of the future blog post. <\/p>\n<\/blockquote>",

All posts in the series can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-series-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Demystifying Azure Security - Series Index<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Azure SQL Databases have a powerful layer of security at the SQL Server level. This layer is provided by the SQL Server <strong>Firewall<\/strong>. Azure provides you granular control to configure this firewall and to manage who gets access to your Azure SQL Database. By default, everything is blocked by the firewall. If you want to get access to Azure SQL Database then you will have to configure the Firewall at the SQL Server level. Only the IP addresses you configure have access to the SQL Databases on the Server.<\/p>\n<p>Another key point to understand is that once you configure a rule then because that rule is applied at the server level, it is applied to all the SQL Databases on that Server. So it is important to ensure that you segregate your databases on different SQL Servers if you don't want to share the access to those databases.<\/p>\n<h3>Accessing the Firewall Settings<\/h3>\n<p>You can access the firewall settings by navigating to your Azure SQL <strong>Database<\/strong>. Then at the top of the blade, you will find the option for &quot;<strong>Set server firewall<\/strong>&quot;. Click on this button to access the firewall settings.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15224826395abf3dcf84ca9.png\" alt=\"Set Server Firewall option on Azure SQL Database\">\n<p>Another way to access the settings is on Azure SQL <strong>Servers<\/strong>. Navigate to the related Azure SQL Server for your database. Under the settings, find the option for &quot;<strong>Firewalls and virtual networks<\/strong>&quot;. Clicking on this will also take you to the same firewall settings as the settings are set at the server level in both ways.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15224826455abf3dd50a424.png\" alt=\"Firewall option on Azure SQL Server\">\n<h3>Firewall Rule Settings<\/h3>\n<p>Let us look at the firewall rule settings in more details. <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, you have the option to enable or disable the <strong>access to Azure services<\/strong> as the toggle for &quot;Allow access to Azure services&quot;. This is set to On by default when creating the Database and SQL server. You can disable it here. This option allows Azure services to provide monitoring data and recommend changes at the database level.<\/li>\n<li>Second, you have the option to <strong>configure a Rule<\/strong>. This is where you configure which IP Addresses have access to the SQL Server.<\/li>\n<li>One commonly used Rule is to open the access for <strong>Client IP<\/strong>. This is the IP address of the machine from where you are connected to the Azure Portal. This is provided for the common scenario where you want to connect and access the SQL database via SSMS (i.e. SQL Server Management Studio) or by any other way from your development box. There is a button to simply add the rule for allowing Client IP by clicking on &quot;<strong>+Add client IP<\/strong>&quot;. The client IP is also authomatically displayed under the &quot;Allow access to Azure services&quot; section<\/li>\n<li>Lastly, there is an option to allow access to the SQL databases from a particular Subnet in a Virtual Network in Azure, without having to manually configure their IP addresses. This feature requires <strong>Service Endpoints<\/strong> to be configured at the Virtual Network level. We will discuss this feature in a later blog. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15224826505abf3ddaaf183.png\" alt=\"Firewall Settings\">\n<p>A typical Rule contains:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>A <strong>Rule Name<\/strong> - which could be any descriptive name for the rule. E.g. it could be name of the single VM for which you want to configure the access or it could be name of the network for which you are opening the access<\/li>\n<li><strong>Start IP<\/strong> - Start of the IP address range for which you want to open the access. E.g. if you want to open access for 10.20.1.0\/24 then the Start IP will be 10.20.1.0<\/li>\n<li><strong>End IP<\/strong> - End of the IP address range for which you want to open the access. E.g. if you want to open access for 10.20.1.0\/24 then the End IP will be 10.20.1.255<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Note: If you want to provide access to only one IP address then provide that IP address for both Start and End IP fields.<\/p>\n<p>Note in the image below that:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The client IP rule was added by clicking on the &quot;+Client IP&quot; button. Note that the Start and End IP are same for this rule<\/li>\n<li>Second is a custom rule which allows access to the SQL Server from a specific VM hosting Website (which will need access to the database)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15224826565abf3de09ea3f.png\" alt=\"Setting Firewall Rules\">\n<p>Once you are done configuring, just hit Save to apply the firewall rules.<\/p>\n<p>Next, we will learn about setting up the <a href=\"http:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-azure-sql-database-firewall-rule-for-virtual-networks\/\" target=\"_blank\">Firewall Rule for Virtual Networks<\/a> and also <a href=\"http:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-azure-sql-database-and-azure-storage-service-endpoints-on-virtual-network\/\" target=\"_blank\">Service Endpoints for Azure SQL on Virtual Network<\/a><\/p>",

If configured it encrypts your database, backups of the database and transactional log files at rest. Normally this is configured by default to provide you with an additional layer of security. If this is not configured then you will get a recommendation to configure it in the Azure Security Center. <\/p>\n<p>Turing Off Transparent data encryption will result in decryption of the complete database and will leave your data vulnerable. When you turn it back On then the database will be encrypted again. Depending upon the size of your database, it may take some time to turn the TDE on or off due to the underlying encryption\/decryption process.<\/p>\n<p>This service does not require any changes at the application level. Behind the scene, transparent data encryption performs real-time I\/O encryption and decryption of the data at the page level. Each page is decrypted when it's read into memory and then encrypted before being written to disk.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Note<\/strong>: Even if the database is encrypted with TDE, when you take an export of the database (e.g. creation of BACPAK file) then the backup file is created without encryption. You need to ensure that you safeguard\/encrypt the backup files before sharing these on an open network.<\/p>\n<h3>Configuring TDE at the Database level<\/h3>\n<p><strong>Transparent Data Encryption<\/strong> (<strong>TDE<\/strong>) can be enabled or disabled at every individual Database level. The configuration is a very simple toggle between on and off. To configure this, navigate to your Azure SQL Database. In the settings, select &quot;Transparent Data Encryption&quot;. The set the value for &quot;Data Encryption&quot; On or Off. <\/p>\n<p>Notice the Encryption status. If you want your data to be encrypted, then the encryption status should say &quot;Encrypted&quot; with a green tick mark. <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15221022915ab9701353492.png\" alt=\"Configuring Transparent Data Encryption\">\n<h3>Configuring to use your own Key with TDE<\/h3>\n<p>You can <strong>use your own Key for encryption<\/strong> with Transparent Data Encryption. If you do not configure to use your own key, then a service managed certificate is used for encryption and decryption.<\/p>\n<p>To do this you will need to upload your key to an Azure Key Vault or generate a new key within the Key Vault, which is very easy to configure. Once you have a key in an Azure Key Vault, you will be able to use the same with Transparent Data Encryption (TDE). <\/p>\n<p>This setting can't be configured at a Database level. Instead, this has to be configured at the server level. Navigate to the underlying Azure SQL Server (where the SQL Database is hosted). Then follow the below steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>In the settings, click on the Transparent Data Encryption<\/li>\n<li>Select &quot;Yes&quot; to Use your own key. <\/li>\n<li>Then click on &quot;Select a Key&quot; and then select the key from your Azure Key Vault. Alternatively, you can select to &quot;Enter Key Identifier&quot;. <\/li>\n<li>Once the key is configured, select &quot;Save&quot; to save the settings.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15221022965ab9701842974.png\" alt=\"Using own Key for encryption with Transparent Data Encryption\">\n<p>This option provides you with all the security at the data level (at rest) while ensuring you have complete control over the process.<\/p>",

All posts in the series can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-series-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Demystifying Azure Security - Series Index<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Before going through this blog, please ensure that you have visited the basics of RBAC Roles in general, explained in a primer here: <a href=\"http:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-rbac-roles\/\" target=\"_blank\">Demystifying Azure Security - RBAC Roles<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This blog explains an easy approach to understand and create your own Custom RBAC Roles in Azure (ARM model). We will inspect an existing simple role and will reverse engineer the way to create Custom RBAC Roles. <\/p>\n<h3>Inspecting Existing Role's Definition<\/h3>\n<p>Start by inspecting any existing Role's Definition. To do this run the cmdlet <strong>Get-AzureRMRoleDefinition<\/strong> and provide the name of any built-in RBAC Role. For this blog, run the below script to inspect the &quot;Reader&quot; and &quot;Virtual Machine Contributor&quot; roles.<\/p>\n<pre><code>Login-AzureRMAccount\n\nGet-AzureRMRoleDefinition -Name \"Reader\" | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File C:\\rbacrole-reader.json\n\nGet-AzureRMRoleDefinition -Name \"Virtual Machine Contributor\" | ConvertTo-Json | Out-File C:\\rbacrole-VMContributor.json<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>If you open and inspect the &quot;rbacrole-reader.json&quot; file you will see the JSON similar to below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"Name\":  \"Reader\",\n    \"Id\":  \"aaaa11a1-3333-48ef-bd42-f606fba81ae7\",\n    \"IsCustom\":  false,\n    \"Description\":  \"Lets you view everything, but not make any changes.\",\n    \"Actions\":  [\n                    \"*\/read\"\n                ],\n    \"NotActions\":  [\n\n                   ],\n    \"AssignableScopes\":  [\n                             \"\/\"\n                         ]\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Notice above that there are below sections in the definition:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Name<\/strong> - Name of the role<\/li>\n<li><strong>Id<\/strong> - unique guid for the role<\/li>\n<li><strong>IsCustom<\/strong> - boolean value. &quot;true&quot; for the Custom Roles and &quot;false&quot; for the built-in roles<\/li>\n<li><strong>Description<\/strong> - description of the role<\/li>\n<li><strong>Actions<\/strong> - Allowed list of actions for the Role<\/li>\n<li><strong>NotActions<\/strong> - Not Allowed list of actions for the Role<\/li>\n<li><strong>AssignableScopes<\/strong> - Scope at which this role can be assigned. E.g. all the subscription Ids. It's mandatory that the RBAC role contains the explicit subscription IDs where it is used otherwise you will not be able to use the role.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Understanding Actions and NotActions<\/h3>\n<p>As mentioned before, Actions describe the allowed list of action for the Role whereas the NotActions describe the not allowed actions for the Role. You can use wildcard * and special syntax to define the Actions and NotActions, as per the Microsoft documentation here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/active-directory\/role-based-access-control-custom-roles\" target=\"_blank\">Create custom roles for Azure Role-Based Access Control<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>Operation strings that contain wildcards (*) grant access to all operations that match the operation string. For instance:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>*\/read<\/code> grants access to read operations for all resource types of all Azure resource providers.<\/li>\n<li><code>Microsoft.Compute\/*<\/code> grants access to all operations for all resource types in the Microsoft.Compute resource provider.<\/li>\n<li><code>Microsoft.Network\/*\/read<\/code> grants access to read operations for all resource types in the Microsoft.Network resource provider of Azure.<\/li>\n<li><code>Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/*<\/code> grants access to all operations of virtual machines and its child resource types.<\/li>\n<li><code>Microsoft.Web\/sites\/restart\/Action<\/code> grants access to restart websites.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use <code>Get-AzureRmProviderOperation<\/code> (in PowerShell) or <code>azure provider operations show<\/code> (in Azure CLI) to list operations of Azure resource providers. You may also use these commands to verify that an operation string is valid and to expand wildcard operation strings.<\/p>\n<pre><code>Get-AzureRMProviderOperation Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/*\/action | FT Operation, OperationName\n\nGet-AzureRMProviderOperation Microsoft.Network\/*<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>Defining a Custom role<\/h3>\n<p>Let's define a custom role, who can start or restart a VM in Azure but can't open a support ticket.<\/p>\n<p>Save the following code as &quot;yourCustomRole01.json&quot; file on your C drive (or any other location).<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n  \"Name\": \"Virtual Machine Start and Restart\",\n  \"Id\": \"7ed03a9f-b372-4341-ba8d-38ef8e614038\",\n  \"IsCustom\": true,\n  \"Description\": \"Can restart virtual machines but can't open support tickets.\",\n  \"Actions\": [\n    \"Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/start\/action\",\n    \"Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/restart\/action\"\n  ],\n  \"NotActions\": [\n    \"Microsoft.Support\/*\"\n  ],\n  \"AssignableScopes\": [\n    \"\/subscriptions\/aaaaaaaa-1111-1111-1111-111111111111\",\n    \"\/subscriptions\/aaaaaaaa-2222-2222-2222-222222222222\",\n    \"\/subscriptions\/aaaaaaaa-3333-3333-3333-333333333333\/resourceGroups\/RG-Prod-USE2\"\n  ]\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Notice the Action and NotAction area are set as per the requirements.<\/p>\n<p>Also, note that under Assignable Scope the role is available for assignment to all Resources and Resource Groups in the first two subscriptions but only in Resource Group named &quot;RG-Prod-USE2&quot; for the third subscription in the list.<\/p>\n<h3>Creating New Custom role<\/h3>\n<p>Once you have the definition ready in a JSON file, you can use the &quot;<strong>New-AzureRMRoleDefinition<\/strong>&quot; cmdlet to create the Custom Role Definition, as shown below. Make sure to alter the path to the json file as per your environment.<\/p>\n<pre><code>New-AzureRMRoleDefinition -InputFile \"C:\\yourCustomRole01.json\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now you will be able to use this new Custom Role while assigning access to someone. You will be able to tweak the access and provide only the access that you need to your internal and external resources.<\/p>",

They are a group of policy definitions to achieve a singular goal. These are the Microsoft recommended way to use the Policies.  <\/p>\n<p>E.g. You want to combine a set of policy definitions for the compute and related resources. You want to apply following set of policies:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Allowed locations - to restrict locations where resources can be deployed<\/li>\n<li>Allowed SKUs - to restrict SKUs for the VMs e.g. VMs can be created with SKU Standard_DS2_v2 only<\/li>\n<li>Enforce Tags and it's default value - to enforce the usage of Tags on resources<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Instead of managing and assigning the policies separately, you can club these policies together in an <strong>Initiative Definition<\/strong> and then assign the same.<\/p>\n<h3>Defining Initiative Definition<\/h3>\n<p>To create a new Initiative Definition you go to your Subscription and then go to the Policies section under Settings. Within Policies go to the <strong>Definitions<\/strong> section under Authoring. Here you can click on the &quot;Initiative Definitions&quot; tab to view the existing definitions. Click on the &quot;+Initiative definition&quot; to create a new Initiative Definition.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220373735ab8727dc341d.png\" alt=\"Creating Initiative Definition\">\n<p>The new Initiative Definition blade with open up. Here you can create the definition. <\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first section, as shown below, is similar to a Policy definition. You will provide the basic information here like Definition location, Name, Description and Category. <\/li>\n<li>On the right side, select the Policies which want to be part of this Initiative Definition in the section &quot;Available Definitions&quot;. Select and Add all the policies that you want to group together.<\/li>\n<li>Configure parameters for the selected Policies in the &quot;Policies and Parameters&quot; section. If you selected a wrong policy, you can delete the policy in this section as well. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220373785ab87282e8f55.png\" alt=\"Initiative Definition Blade\">\n<h3>Initiative Parameters<\/h3>\n<p>Continuing with the previous section of the Policy definition, you have lots of options when configuring parameters under the &quot;Policies and Parameters&quot; section. You can either &quot;<strong>Set value<\/strong>&quot; right within the Initiative Definition, or you can &quot;<strong>Use Initiative Parameter<\/strong>&quot;. Set the values within the definition if you don't want to change during the assignment. If you want to set the values dynamically then use the Initiative Parameters.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Initiative Parameters<\/strong> are used to parameterize the Initiative Definition. These can be set from the list of allowed values (a subset of all the values) during the assignment.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220373835ab87287b145a.png\" alt=\"Options for setting values for Parameters\">\n<p>When you select to use an Initiative Parameter for any value, then a parameter is automatically created. <\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220373895ab8728d4f4b0.png\" alt=\"Initiative Parameters\">\n<p>You can create your own Initiative parmeters as well. If an Initiative parameter is not being used then you won't be able to save that definition. You will get &quot;Bad Request&quot; while trying to save the definition.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220373945ab87292397f6.png\" alt=\"Option for creating new Initiative Parameter\">\n<h3>Assigning Initiative Definition<\/h3>\n<p>The Initiative assignment is exactly same as the Policy Assignment. All the options are similar as well. You provide value to the parameters within the Initiative Definition for all the policies, during the assignment.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15220373995ab872973ab67.png\" alt=\"Assigning Initiative Definition\">",

Then using PowerShell to deploy the policy is as easy as executing below two cmdlets:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong><em>New-AzureRmPolicyDefinition<\/em><\/strong> - to create the policy definition <\/li>\n<li><strong><em>New-AzureRMPolicyAssignment<\/em><\/strong> - to use the policy and assign the policy at a scope defined<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Store the policy in a json file on your computer. Ensure that you only save the &quot;if-then&quot; condition in curly parenthesis. This will be used as an input to the cmdlet. The file should look similar to below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n            \"if\": { &lt;&lt;content here&gt;&gt;},\n            \"then\":{ &lt;&lt;content here&gt;&gt;}\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>To create the policy definition use a code similar to below. Ensure to update the file name and path as per your environment.<\/p>\n<pre><code>$definition = $definition = New-AzureRmPolicyDefinition -Name \"RestrictingUbuntuVMVersion\" -DisplayName \"Restrict Ubuntu version for VM Deployment\" -Description \"Detailed Description here\" -Policy \"C:\\temp\\CustomPolicyDefinition.json\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>To use the policy, do the assignment using a code similar to below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>$assignment = New-AzureRMPolicyAssignment -Name &lt;customAssignmentName&gt; -Scope &lt;SubscriptionId&gt;  -PolicyDefinition $definition<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>That is all there is to defining and using your custom policy.<\/p>",

In simple terms it allows you to control access to a VM. When you enable JIT, all access is locked down on the VM on all ports. This is done via Network Security Group (NSG) rules. The access is granted only for the duration allowed and also only on the ports requested. And then everything is locked down again at the end of the duration.<\/p>\n<p>The attackers are leveraging various ways to get into your environment. One such way is using Bots to automate and Brute Force method to attempt entering in your environment. If you need to access a VM, in your environment, from Internet without VPN (e.g. to change some files on a Web app VM) then you are potentially opening up 3389 port on the VM and that can become a target for the attackers. Locking down the VM except when you need it and only for the duration of the requirement, reduces these risks significantly. <\/p>\n<h3>Pre-requisites<\/h3>\n<p>The key pre-requisites to be able to use this feature are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Azure Security Center needs to be upgraded to Advanced Security as shown below<\/li>\n<li>The VM on which you want to configure JIT access should have a Network Security Group (NSG) linked to it. If it doesn't have any then you can create one and associate it with the network interface of the VM.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The first pre-requisite requires you to upgrade the Security Center to Advanced Security that comes with <strong>Standard Tier<\/strong>. You can upgrade from any of the advanced features. The portal will automatically prompt you to upgrade as shown below:<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15212356695aac36d55f4be.png\" alt=\"Advanced Security in Security Center\">\n<h3>How to Access and Configure it<\/h3>\n<p>To configure this go to Azure <strong>Security Center<\/strong>. Within Security Center go to the &quot;Advanced Cloud Defense&quot; category and then click on &quot;Just in time VM access&quot; link as shown below:<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15212354315aac35e7b2c2d.png\" alt=\"JIT in Security Center\">\n<p>Next follow the below steps to enable JIT on a VM:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Ensure that you are in the JIT section of Security Center<\/li>\n<li>Go to the &quot;Recommended&quot; tab. This will show you all the VMs in your environment. <\/li>\n<li>Click on the VM for which you want to enable Just in Time access. You can select multiple VMs here.<\/li>\n<li>Click on the &quot;Enable JIT on x VMs&quot; button<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15212369445aac3bd0c8b26.png\" alt=\"Enabling JIT\">\n<p>You will be presented with various settings for enabling JIT. These settings can be configured as:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>By default, various common ports are configured for JIT access with 3 hours time range. E.g. 3389 for RDP. Click on any of the default ports to tweak the settings.<\/li>\n<li>You can add more ports and protocols by clicking on the &quot;Add&quot; button at the top.<\/li>\n<li>Tweak the settings on the new blade that opens up.<\/li>\n<li>Click on &quot;Save&quot; to save your settings.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15212369535aac3bd974b55.png\" alt=\"Settings while enabling JIT\">\n<p>That's all there is to it. Once JIT is configured you can view the VM in the &quot;Configured&quot; tab.<\/p>\n<h3>Requesting access and activity log in JIT<\/h3>\n<p>You can request access and perform various other management operations by following below steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Once the JIT is configured, the VM will show up in the &quot;Configured&quot; tab as shown below. <\/li>\n<li>Click on the VM that you want to manage or request access to. <\/li>\n<li>As soon as you click, &quot;Request access&quot; button will start showing. You can click the button and it will ask for the number of hours that you need the access and the corresponding ports on which you need the access. Please note that only ports configured earlier can be granted access.<\/li>\n<li>Click on the ellipse i.e. 3 dots in front of the VM record and you will see various options. Using these options you can view Properties. You can view the Activity log for previous requests and any attempts on attack. You can also Edit or Remove the access.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15212369585aac3bde79755.png\" alt=\"Requesting access and activity log in JIT\">\n<h3>Adding non-Azure computers<\/h3>\n<p>You can add non-Azure computers for an extra fee per Node. Cost is calculated based on 15 USD\/Node\/Month. Resources that count as a node are VMs and computers. The selected security tier will be applied to current and new resources. For more information, visit <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/security-center\/security-center-pricing\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft Security Center's Standard tier for enhanced security<\/a> information page.<\/p>\n<p>Ensure that you have onboarded the non-Azure computers to a linked Azure Log Analytics workspace. This is required in order to onboard non-Azure computers to Security Center.<\/p>",

Part 1 is located here:  <a href=\"http:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/troubleshooting-azure-site-recovery-asr-data-replication-not-working\/\" target=\"_blank\">Troubleshooting Azure Site Recovery (ASR) - Data Replication Not Working<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Go through the part 1 before this blog as that talks about the location of logs and various preliminary steps. This blog talks about the issue where you are not even able to enable Data Replication for a server. <\/p>\n<h3>Preliminary Checks<\/h3>\n<p>Perform the following basic checks related to connectivity:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure that the ASR management server has connectivity with Azure.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure connectivity between the management server (process server) and the source machine which you are trying to replicate. Ensure that the source machine is accessible from the process server.\n<ul>\n<li>You will also need to enable and allow \u201cFile and Printer Sharing\u201d on the source machine in the Windows Firewall. <\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<li>Ensure that the account that you use for enabling the protection has administrator rights on the source machine. This is needed for installation of the Mobility services agent on the source machine.<\/li>\n<li>Also allow Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) in the Windows Firewall, if not already.<\/li>\n<li>Disable remote User Account Control (UAC) if you are using local administrator account to install the mobility service.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Checking Services<\/h3>\n<p>Also, check whether the following services are running and configured correctly on the source machine:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>If <strong>Volume Shadow Copy(VSS)<\/strong> service Startup Type is set to Disabled, change it to Automatic.<\/li>\n<li>If <strong>COM+ System Application(COMSysApp)<\/strong> service Startup Type is to Disabled, change it to Automatic.<\/li>\n<li>If the Microsoft <strong>Distributed Transaction Coordinator Service (MSDTC)<\/strong> Startup Type is set to Disabled, change it to Automatic.<\/li>\n<li>If the service Startup Types were already set to Automatic, check if COM+ enumeration succeeds. a) You check COM+ enumeration by Component Services (comexp.msc) b) Browse to Component Service -&gt; Computers -&gt; My Computer -&gt; COM+ Application. You should be able to expand the System Application node and see the contents under that node. c) Ensure that Volume Shadow Copy Service is listed under Component Service -&gt; Computers -&gt; My Computer -&gt; DCOM config<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Alternate Option<\/h3>\n<p>If for any reason you can't enable any of the above steps, e.g. if you can't provide admin access to the service account on the source machine or disable remote UAC, then you have an alternative option. You can install the Mobility services agent on the source machine prior to enabling the protection. You will still need the services to be configured appropriately but will not need admin access while enabling the protection. To install the mobility services agent, you have various options:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"vmware-azure-mobility-install-configuration-mgr.md\">Install using software deployment tools like System Center Configuration Manager<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"vmware-azure-mobility-deploy-automation-dsc.md\">Install with Azure Automation and Desired State Configuration (Automation DSC)<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"vmware-azure-install-mobility-service.md#install-mobility-service-manually-by-using-the-gui\">Install manually from the UI<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"vmware-azure-install-mobility-service.md#install-mobility-service-manually-at-a-command-prompt\">Install manually from a command prompt<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"vmware-azure-install-mobility-service.md#install-mobility-service-by-push-installation-from-azure-site-recovery\">Install using the Site Recovery push installation<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>All these options are described in details here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/site-recovery\/vmware-azure-install-mobility-service\" target=\"_blank\">Install the Mobility service<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Next Steps<\/h3>\n<p>Restart the job after ensuring all the pre-requisites as described in previous sections. If you are still facing issues, revisit the Part 1 of the troubleshooting series as mentioned at the beginning of this blog. Let us know in comments below if the issue persists. <\/p>",

All posts in the series can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-series-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Demystifying Azure Security - Series Index<\/a>. Ensure that you have read earlier blogs about the basics of Azure Policies before reading this blog.<\/p>\n<h3>Structure of a Policy JSON Definition<\/h3>\n<p>Policy definitions are written in JSON. The policy definition contains elements for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>mode<\/li>\n<li>parameters<\/li>\n<li>display name<\/li>\n<li>description<\/li>\n<li>policy rule\n<ul>\n<li>logical evaluation<\/li>\n<li>effect<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let's understand these components with the help of an example. Earlier we saw how to find the definition of existing policies. One such policy is: &quot;Allowed locations&quot;. This policy restricts the location in Azure where resources can be deployed. The definition for the policy looks like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n  \"properties\": {\n    \"mode\": \"all\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n      \"allowedLocations\": {\n        \"type\": \"array\",\n        \"metadata\": {\n          \"description\": \"The list of locations that can be specified when deploying resources\",\n          \"strongType\": \"location\",\n          \"displayName\": \"Allowed locations\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    \"displayName\": \"Allowed locations\",\n    \"description\": \"This policy enables you to restrict the locations your organization can specify when deploying resources.\",\n    \"policyRule\": {\n      \"if\": {\n        \"not\": {\n          \"field\": \"location\",\n          \"in\": \"[parameters('allowedLocations')]\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"then\": {\n        \"effect\": \"deny\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Mode<\/strong> tells you the type of resources for which the policy will be applied. Allowed values are &quot;All&quot; (where all Resource Groups and Resources are evaluated) and &quot;indexed&quot; (where policy is evaluated only for resources which support tags and location)<\/li>\n<li><strong>Parameters<\/strong> are used for providing inputs to the policy. They can be reused at multiple locations within the policy. You can refer to a parameter as: &quot;<strong><em>[parameters('allowedLocations')]<\/em><\/strong>&quot;<\/li>\n<li><strong>Display Name<\/strong> is used to show the policy in the portal or programmatically.<\/li>\n<li>A <strong>description<\/strong> is used to provide details for the policy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Policy Rule<\/strong> is which defines the policies. This is the section where the restrictions are defined in a Poicy Definition. To understand a policy you need to focus most of your efforts on this section. Every Policy rule has two key sections defined under &quot;if-then&quot; blocks. \n<ol>\n<li><strong>Logical Evaluation<\/strong> is defined under the &quot;if&quot; block. It defines the condition which is evaluated to determine the policy should be applied or not.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Effect<\/strong> is defined in the &quot;then&quot; block. This defines what will happen if the condition is met. <\/li>\n<\/ol><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Policy Rules<\/h3>\n<p>Let's look at the policy rules in more details. The general syntax of the &quot;if-then&quot; block is as shown below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n  \"if\": {\n    &lt;condition&gt; | &lt;logical operator&gt;\n  },\n  \"then\": {\n    \"effect\": \"deny | audit | append\"\n  }\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Supported logical operators are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>\"not\": {condition  or operator}<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>\"allOf\": [{condition or operator},{condition or operator}]<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>\"anyOf\": [{condition or operator},{condition or operator}]<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Not<\/strong> operator means that the opposit of the condition should be true for the policy to be applied. <strong>AllOf<\/strong> requires all the conditions defined to be true at the same time. <strong>AnyOf<\/strong> requires any one of the conditions to be true for the policy to be applied.<\/p>\n<p>In the previous example, the policy rule section is as shown below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>    \"policyRule\": {\n      \"if\": {\n        \"not\": {\n          \"field\": \"location\",\n          \"in\": \"[parameters('allowedLocations')]\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"then\": {\n        \"effect\": \"deny\"\n      }\n    }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>In simple terms, the rule above says that if the location is not in the list of allowed locations, defined by the parameter <strong><em>allowedLocations<\/em><\/strong>, then the effect will be <strong><em>deny<\/em><\/strong> i.e. the resource creation will not be allowed.<\/p>\n<p>You can find the complete list of operators and conditional constructs here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/azure-policy\/policy-definition\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Policy definition structure\n<\/a><\/p>",

Click on &quot;Select&quot; once done.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15217894445ab4aa0494a0d.png\" alt=\"Selecting Policy\">\n<p>Select the Scope for applying the policy. You can leave the default to the Subscription level. Or you can click on the blue button in front of scope text box and select the Resource Groups under the subscription on which you want to apply the policy.<\/p>\n<p>You can also select the Exclusions if you require. These Resource Group or resources will not be evaluated against the policy.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15217894615ab4aa15470ec.png\" alt=\"Selecting Scope\">\n<p>Lastly, you will have additional parameters for the policy related values. These parameters will vary and will depend on the policy you have selected. E.g. For &quot;Allowed locations&quot; policy, you will see the parameter for allowed locations. Select &quot;East US&quot; and &quot;East US 2&quot; for the locations as an example.<\/p>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15217894765ab4aa248f15f.png\" alt=\"Providing value for Policy related Parameters\">\n<p>Once you complete the configurations, click on the &quot;<strong>Assign<\/strong>&quot; button to apply the policy<\/p>\n<h3>Validating the Policy<\/h3>\n<p>To validate the policy for &quot;Allowed locations&quot; follow these steps:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Try to deploy a Storage Account or a VM or any other resource in a location that is NOT allowed. E.g. try deploying a storage account in the &quot;West US&quot; location. This should fail with the validation error stating the policy id.<\/li>\n<li>Perform the same deployment but to one of the allowed location. E.g. try deploying a storage account in the &quot;East US&quot; location. This should succeed without any erros. <\/li>\n<\/ol>",

The focus is to provide only the access necessary so that an account in your organization doesn't have more access than needed. In case the account gets compromised, this will ensure that does not leave your environment too much vulnerable. This means that if you grant an employee access to manage Virtual Machines in your environment, that employee can't alter the virtual networks by mistake or have any access to delete the storage accounts in the environment. <\/p>\n<h3>Roles Hierarchy<\/h3>\n<p>The RBAC Roles can be assigned at the following three levels in the order of hierarchy:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Subscription<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Resource Group<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><strong>Resource<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Any Resource in Azure, must belong to a Resource Group (under the ARM model). And every Resource Group in Azure must belong to a single subscription.<\/p>\n<p>If a person is assigned scope at Subscription level then he\/she will get access to all Resource Groups and to all resources within those resource groups. Next, if a person is assigned access at a Resource Group level then they will automatically get access to all the Resources within that Resource Group. Finally, if a person is provided access only to an individual Resource then they will get access only to that Resource.<\/p>\n<h3>Built-in Roles<\/h3>\n<p>There are various inbuilt roles for this purpose like:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Contributor - create and manage but can't grant access to others<\/li>\n<li>Reader - can only view<\/li>\n<li>Owner - full access<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The complete list of Built-in roles can be viewed here: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/active-directory\/role-based-access-built-in-roles\" target=\"_blank\">Built-in roles for Azure role-based access control<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Viewing and Adding Access<\/h3>\n<p>To view or Add access, first decide the scope where you want to provide the access. Select the scope, e.g. a Resource Group on which you want to view existing access and grant the access to someone. Then follow these steps (as per the image below):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on &quot;Access Control (IAM)&quot; to access the RBAC access control<\/li>\n<li>View the access in the center area. Scroll down to view all type of roles and Users, Groups or Apps with the access<\/li>\n<li>Click on &quot;+Add&quot; button, as shown below, to add access to a new user, group or application<\/li>\n<li>In the new popup blade, select the Role (e.g. Contributor), Assignment scope and name\/email address of the user or app to whom you want to grant the access. You can select multiple users\/apps as well.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15216952115ab339eba24e0.png\" alt=\"Viewing and Adding RBAC Access\">\n<p>Within each subscription, you can grant up to 2000 role assignments.<\/p>\n<p>Learn about creating Custom RBAC Roles here: <a href=\"http:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-custom-rbac-roles\/\" target=\"_blank\">Demystifying Azure Security - Custom RBAC Roles<\/a><\/p>",

All posts in the series can be found here: <a href=\"http:\/\/harvestingclouds.com\/post\/demystifying-azure-security-series-index\/\" target=\"_blank\">Demystifying Azure Security - Series Index<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Azure Policies<\/strong> are a great tool to make access to Azure more secure by prohibiting certain operations and enforcing various rules in your environment. The policies make your environment compliant and ensure that you adhere to the service level agreements and standards set within your organization. If the end user tries to deploy a resource violating the policies then the deployment fails at the validation step ensuring that your environment remains compliant. If you already have resources which are not compliant then you will be able to review those and take necessary actions.<\/p>\n<h3>Examples of Azure Policies<\/h3>\n<p>Here are a few of most commonly used policies:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Restricting the Allowed locations<\/strong> where a resource can be deployed. You can restrict the allowed locations where resources can be deployed to the ones that are closer to your geographic location. This also ensures that the users within your organization can't deploy resources to noncompliant locations. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Enforcing a Tag<\/strong> and it's Value. E.g. You have a Resource Group for the Finance department. You want to ensure that any resource deployed in that Resource Group should be tagged with a &quot;CostCenter&quot; and a specific value for that cost center. You can enforce this using a Policy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Not Allowed Resource Types<\/strong>. Using this policy you can prohibit the deployment of certain resource types in your environment. <\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There are various other built-in Policies. You can also create your own policies which we will discuss in more detail later.<\/p>\n<h3>Scope where a Policy is Assigned<\/h3>\n<p>A Policy can be assigned at the below levels:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Subscription<\/strong> level - Applied to all Resource Groups and Resources within the subscription<\/li>\n<li><strong>Resource Group<\/strong> level - Applied only to the Resources within the selected Resource Groups<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>Exclusions<\/strong>: In addition to the assignment scope, you can exclude certain Resource Groups or individual Resources from the Policy assignments. The Policy will be applied to all the Resources in the scope except the ones excluded by defining the Exclusions. <\/p>\n<h3>How are Policies different from Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)<\/h3>\n<p>Through <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)<\/strong>, you focus on the role and scope of access that a user can have in Azure. You provide the access control (IAM) within Azure for Subscription, Resource Group or an individual Resource. You define a role for the user\/app\/group like Contributor, Reader etc.  You can use the built-in roles or can define custom roles.<\/p>\n<p>With <strong>Policies<\/strong>, you focus on the properties of the resources with which the user can work at the defined scope. You define what properties are allowed and what is restricted. You can use the built-in policies or can define your own.<\/p>\n<p>E.g. Through RBAC you define that a particular user has Reader role at the subscription and Contributor role at a particular Resource Group. This will mean that the user can view all the resources in the subscription but can only modify or create resources in the Resource Group where he has Contributor access.<\/p>\n<p>Now if you define a policy which restricts the type of resources deployed ( as discussed in the examples above), the user will not be able to deploy the restricted resource types, even though he has contributor access to a Resource Group.<\/p>\n<h3>Accessing Policies in the Azure portal<\/h3>\n<p>To access the Policies in the Azure portal:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to <strong>Subscriptions<\/strong> (via All Services or the navigation sidebar)<\/li>\n<li>Select the subscription for which you want to view the Policies<\/li>\n<li>Scroll down to the &quot;Settings&quot; category in the menu of the subscription<\/li>\n<li>Click on &quot;<strong>Policies<\/strong>&quot; to access the policies in Azure<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15217849365ab4986888c88.png\" alt=\"Policies in Azure Portal\">\n<p>We will be discussing more about the Azure Policies in later blogs.<\/p>",

The first thing to note is that these are only related to VM disks and not general blob storage. In this post, lets take a look at what all benefits you get when you create your virtual machine with a managed disk instead of a storage account based disks.<\/p>\n<h3>More Controlled Access Management<\/h3>\n<p>Let's assume a scenario where all the disks for the virtual machines in your environment belonged to a particular storage account. Let us say that there are VMs belonging to Finance as well as HR departments. Now if you want to give access to a VHD file of a VM belonging to HR department, you will provide the access to the storage account. This was the lowest level where you could provide the access. This inadvertently opened the access to the Finance VM's VHD files as well.<\/p>\n<p>Managed Disks are individual resources in Azure. If a VM has 1 OS disk and 2 data disks, all implemented as a managed disk, then you can even provide the access to one of the data disk and not provide access to any of the other disks.<\/p>\n<h3>No Storage account service limits<\/h3>\n<p>Earlier with storage accounts there were Service Limits related to IOPS at the storage account level. When the infrastructure grew and there comes a time the number of disks grew to a point that this service limit will be hit and this can affect your architecture. With managed disks, you are no longer limited by the storage account limits.<\/p>\n<h3>Ability to take Snapshot<\/h3>\n<p>Now with managed disks you have the capability to take snapshots on the fly. You can later restore from these snapshots as required. You can take these snapshots onto a different storage account.<\/p>\n<h3>Ability to Capture better images<\/h3>\n<p>The images that you capture on the Vms, which are created using managed disks, will not just include the OS disk, but will also include all the data disk.<\/p>\n<h3>Ability to convert a Standard disk to Premium disk and vice versa<\/h3>\n<p>Earlier if you wanted to convert a standard disk to a premium disk (or vice versa) you needed to create a new storage account and copy over the disk. Now with managed disks, this is as easy as shutting down the virtual machine and just changing a value in a drop down.<\/p>\n<h3>Other benefits<\/h3>\n<p>Other benefits include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Better reliability for Availability Sets<\/li>\n<li>Highly durable and available with design for 99.999% availability<\/li>\n<li>Better Azure Backup service support with the ability to create a backup job with time-based backups, easy VM restoration, and backup retention policies<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Reference: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-ca\/services\/managed-disks\/\" target=\"_blank\">Managed Disks product page<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/virtual-machines\/windows\/managed-disks-overview\" target=\"_blank\">Managed Disks overview<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>",

What this means is that you do not need to install any dependencies for the Azure commands to run. Also, there is no dependency on your machine's hardware. You can work irrespective of your local machine's configurations.<\/p>\n<h3>Support for various tools<\/h3>\n<p>Azure Cloud Shell comes preloaded with various tools depending upon the shell type selected. It comes loaded with Linux tools like bash, sh, tmux and dig. The Azure tools which are preloaded are Azure CLI 2.0 and 1.0, AzCopy,etc.Text editors include vim and nano. Git source control tools are also included. Various other Build, Containers, Databases, etc. tools are also included. It also comes with language support for .net version 2.0.0, Java version 1.8, Node.js 6.9.4, PowerShell 6.0(beta) and Python 2.7 and 3.5 etc. Check the References section for the full list and up to date version of Tools and Language support.<\/p>\n<h3>Key Concepts<\/h3>\n<p>Below are some of the key concepts (in nutshell) about the cloud shell.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can opt for any one of the two shell options available, as per your preferences. You can choose to have a <strong>Bash shell<\/strong> or <strong>PowerShell in Cloud shell<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>You can easily switch between the two shells at any time<\/li>\n<li>If you are logged into Azure portal then you are also automatically authenticated into the Azure Cloud Shell<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Other important concepts as per Microsoft documentation are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cloud Shell runs on a temporary host provided on a per-session,\nper-user basis <\/li>\n<li>Cloud Shell times out after 20 minutes without\ninteractive activity <\/li>\n<li>Cloud Shell requires an Azure file share to be\nmounted <\/li>\n<li>Cloud Shell uses the same Azure file share for both Bash and\nPowerShell <\/li>\n<li>Cloud Shell is assigned one machine per user account <\/li>\n<li>Bash persists $Home using a 5-GB image held in your file share<\/li>\n<li>Permissions are set as a regular Linux user in Bash<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Pricing<\/h3>\n<p>Cloud Shell does not have any direct cost linked to it. The charge for Cloud Shell is only for the usage of the underlying Azure Storage. The exact charge depends on the amount you store on that storage and the type of the storage. By default, Locally Redundant Storage is created. <\/p>\n<p><strong>References<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/cloud-shell\/overview\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Cloud Shell Overview<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/cloud-shell\/features\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Cloud Shell Features and Tools<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/cloud-shell\/features-powershell\" target=\"_blank\">Features &amp; tools for PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>",

			"postDate": "14-11-2016",
			"tags": [
				"ASR",
				"Azure",
				"AzureSiteRecovery"
			],
			"category": "Azure",
			"body": "<p>If you have the Azure Site Recovery (ASR) setup in your environment and are facing the issue where the data replication is stuck, then follow this blog to troubleshoot. The data replication can be stuck either during the initial replication or during the delta changes. This can occur for various reasons. We will inspect various components involved in ASR. Major of the troubleshooting is done on the Management Server i.e. the on-premise Configuration\/Master target server.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Check Alerts Details<\/h3>\n<p>Go to the Azure Site Recovery Vault and navigate to the settings. Click on the <strong><em>Alerts and Events<\/em><\/strong>. Check the alerts for the data replication being blocked etc. Verify that the problem is related to data replication and not something else. <\/p>\n<p>You can also navigate to the &quot;<strong><em>Replicated Items<\/em><\/strong>&quot; in the ASR Vault settings. On the blade for replicated items, click on the server for which the data is not being replicated. A new blade will open for this server's properties Then click on the Error Details on the server properties blade's context menu (which you can access by clicking on the top right ellipse i.e. 3 dots).<\/p>\n<p>After verifying the issue, proceed to next sections to troubleshoot.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Check Resource Monitor<\/h3>\n<p>Check if you see any activity in the Resource Monitor. This is also to validate if the issue is there or not. Sometimes the <strong>Low Bandwidth<\/strong> and <strong>multiple servers<\/strong> configured against one Management server can cause this issue. Ensure that this is not the scenario in your case.<\/p>\n<p>From the Task manager, go to performance view and check for the bandwidth consumption. Then click on the &quot;Open Resource Monitor&quot; button to launch the Resource Monitor. From the CPU section in the Overview tab, select the below two services:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>cxps.exe<\/li>\n<li>cbengine.exe<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Then click on the Network tab and see if there is any traffic going out to Azure. If the data transfer is going on without issues then you should be able to view entries against cbengine going out to a URL which will look something like &quot;blob.aaa1aaa1aa.core.windows.net&quot; and entries against the csps service .<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/images\/1479242042582b713a13d26.png\" alt=\"Resource Monitor\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>3. Check ASR Infrastructure Setup<\/h3>\n<p>First of all, check if the ASR infrastructure setup is correct and nothing is wrong there. To view this, navigate to the ASR Vault. Go to the settings and click on the &quot;Site Recovery Infrastructure&quot;. In the next blade, click on the kind of infrastructure you have setup. E.g. If you are replicating from VMWare or Physical Machines from on-premise to Azure then click on the &quot;Configuration Servers&quot; under the &quot;For VMWare &amp; Physical Machines&quot; section.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/images\/1479235374582b572e7bd28.png\" alt=\"Site Recovery Infrastructure\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here check if the Config Server is showing as &quot;Connected&quot;. If not then the problem is in the communication between Configuration Server and the Azure. Ensure that you are able to connect to the Azure portal from the config server. Also, ensure that all the public URLs for Azure are accessible. Check this link for exact URLs: <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/azure\/site-recovery\/site-recovery-best-practices#verify-url-access\">Verify URL Access<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Next, click on the configuration server. This will open another blade with details for the configuration server. Expand the section for &quot;Associated Servers&quot; as marked no. 2 in the screenshot below. Check if all the associated servers, i.e. Process Server, vCenter Server and Master Target servers are connected and showing green tick mark.<\/p>\n<p>Next, check the configuration server health as shown at no. 3 below. Check if all the services are running and showing healthy. Ensure that you have sufficient free space on the configuration server to send the replication data. If you see any services not running then go to the next section to check and start the services on the Management Server on-premise. <\/p>\n<p>You can try refreshing the server after making any configuration changes on it, e.g. increasing memory or freeing up disk space. Click on the &quot;Refresh Server&quot; button as shown at no. 4, at the top of the blade for the configuration server.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/images\/1479235804582b58dc26f55.png\" alt=\"Config Server Settings\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>4. Checking Services on the Management Server<\/h3>\n<p>Check if the services on the Management Server are up and running. You need to check for the below services:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>InMage PushInstall<\/li>\n<li>InMage Scout Application Service<\/li>\n<li>InMage Scout VX Agent - Sentinel\/Outpost<\/li>\n<li>INMAGE-AppScheduler<\/li>\n<li>Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent<\/li>\n<li>Microsoft Azure Site Recovery Service<\/li>\n<li>cxprocessserver (This is important service. It is the service for the InMage CX Process Server)<\/li>\n<li>tmansvc (This is the service for the InMage Volsync Thread Manager Service)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Start any service which is not running and check if the problem still exists. 90% of the time the problem is going to be because of something related to these services (e.g. a restart or patch stopped one of these services).<\/p>\n<h3>5. Checking Services on the Server being replicated<\/h3>\n<p>Check if the services on the Server being replicated are up and running. You need to check for the below services:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Azure Site Recovery VSS Provider<\/li>\n<li>InMage Scout Application Service<\/li>\n<li>InMage Scout VX Agent - Sentinel\/Outpost<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Start any service which is not running and check if the problem still exists.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Verify Service Account credentials are correct and have required access<\/h3>\n<p>The replication can stop if the service account is not correct or it doesn't have required access. Check if the service account's password expired or changed. <\/p>\n<p>You can use the Configuration Server config tool to check and update the service accounts. This tool can be accessed from this directory path: &quot;<em>D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Azure Site Recovery\\home\\svsystems\\bin<\/em>&quot; where D is your install directory for ASR setup. The tool name under this directory is &quot;<strong>cspsconfigtool.exe<\/strong>&quot;.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/images\/1479238579582b63b3688bd.png\" alt=\"CSPS Config Tool\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>7. Check Logs<\/h3>\n<p>There are various ASR logs that gets generated in the Management server. Two key logs that you should check are as shown below. This assumes that D is the directory where ASR is installed.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Monitoring Logs<\/strong> - These logs are located at &quot;<em>D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Azure Site Recovery\\home\\svsystems\\var<\/em>&quot;. Name of the file you should check is &quot;<strong>monitor_ps<\/strong>&quot;.<\/li>\n<li><strong>VM-Specific ASR Logs<\/strong> - These logs are located at &quot;<em>D:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Azure Site Recovery\\home\\svsystems<\/em>&quot;. Then there will be a folder with the name as a GUID for each VM. Navigate to the folder with the Guid and try to find the folder for your VM's GUID. One indication will be the number of disks and the disk sizes. Once you have located the folder for one of the VM having replication problems. Then navigate to internal folders and locate the perf.log file for your VM's disks. Check to see if there are any errors here.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>These logs should give you an idea as to what may have been causing the issues.<\/p>\n<h3>In Conclusion<\/h3>\n<p>After all these steps and any changes you should Refresh the Configuration Server as shown in the point 3 above. <\/p>\n<p>Let me know if this blog helped in your scenario. <\/p>",

This extension resource should be of type &quot;<strong>CustomScriptExtension<\/strong>&quot;. You provide the URLs to the PowerShell scripts inside this custom script extension.<\/p>\n<h3>Preparation<\/h3>\n<p>As part of the preparation process you need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure that the PowerShell scripts are uploaded to the Storage Account and that you have the complete URL to the blob. <\/li>\n<li>Or you can upload the scripts to the GitHub and get the Raw file URL<\/li>\n<li>If there are more than one scripts then there should be one master script amongst all ps1 files which will internally invoke other files. This master file will be triggered via the template. Information of all file URLs will also be provided via the Template<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Providing and configuring Scripts to Run After VM Deployment<\/h3>\n<p>Define the below resource to provide PowerShell scripts to be run after VM deployment:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n   \"type\": \"Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/extensions\",\n   \"name\": \"MyCustomScriptExtension\",\n   \"apiVersion\": \"2015-05-01-preview\",\n   \"location\": \"[parameters('location')]\",\n   \"dependsOn\": [\n       \"[concat('Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/',parameters('vmName'))]\"\n   ],\n   \"properties\": {\n       \"publisher\": \"Microsoft.Compute\",\n       \"type\": \"CustomScriptExtension\",\n       \"typeHandlerVersion\": \"1.7\",\n       \"autoUpgradeMinorVersion\":true,\n       \"settings\": {\n           \"fileUris\": [\n           \"http:\/\/Yourstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net\/customscriptfiles\/start.ps1\",\n           \"http:\/\/Yourstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net\/customscriptfiles\/secondaryScript.ps1\",\n\n       ],\n       \"commandToExecute\": \"powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File start.ps1\"\n     }\n   }\n }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><strong>How it works:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Both the files i.e. start.ps1 and secondaryScript.ps1 are picked up from the storage account after VM deployment.

You can add more files if needed.<\/li>\n<li>The &quot;start.ps1&quot; is the main powerShell script which should be invoking the secondaryScript.ps1 internally<\/li>\n<li>CommandToExecutre property is used to invoke the start.ps1 powerShell script on the deployed VM<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Passing Parameters to the PowerShell Script dynamically<\/h3>\n<p>To pass the parameters to the PowerShell script use commandToExecute property. <\/p>\n<p>One such example to pass the parameters is shown below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"commandToExecute\": \"[concat('powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File start.ps1', ' -domainName ', parameters('domainNameParameter')]\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Note the use of &quot;concat&quot; helper function to create the value of the &quot;commandToExecute&quot;. Also note that there is starting and trailing space in the second argument of the concat i.e. &quot; -domainName &quot;.<\/p>\n<p>The parameter &quot;domainNameParameter&quot; should already be defined in the template in the parameters section. If the value of parameter &quot;domainNameParameter&quot; is &quot;testdomain.com&quot; then the dynamically generated command will become:<\/p>\n<pre><code>powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File start.ps1 -domainName testdomain.com<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>Securing the Access to the PowerShell Script File in Storage account<\/h3>\n<p>Let us assume you want to deploy Windows VM with Protected settings.

You don't need to compromise the security of the system while trying to automate deployments. Your end goal is to try to automate as much as possible and reduce manual involvement. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Key Vaults<\/strong> are there to solve this problem without compromising any security. In fact, they make the whole solution more secure with least manual intervention.<\/p>\n<h3>Setting up the Key Vault<\/h3>\n<p>We first need to setup the Key Vault in Azure to be able to use it via ARM Template parameters.<\/p>\n<ol>\n    <li>\n<b>Create a Key Vault in Azure<\/b> by going to <i>New -> Security + Identity -> Key Vault<\/i>. Provide a name, subscription, resource group etc. and provision the Key Vault. Once it is created navigate to it by clicking on \"More Services\" and searching for Key Vault. Click on the name of the vault you created. E.g. In this example we have named the key vault to \"TestKeyVault101\".\n\n<br \/>\n<b>Note<\/b> that this feature is in Preview  at the time of writing of this blog.\n\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\n        Next, we need to <b>Add a Secret<\/b> in the key vault. Click on the Secrets and then the + Add button at the top, as shown below:\n<br \/><br \/>\n<img alt=\"Adding Secret\" src=\"\/images\/1476818644580676d447b16.png\" \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\nNext, in the \"Create a secret\" blade, set the Upload Options to Manual. Provide a name and value to the secret. Value is the password you want to securely save.\nEnsure that the Enabled is set to Yes. Optionally you can set the activation and expiration dates. In this example, we are setting the Secret Name to \"DefaultAdminPasswordSecret\".\n<br \/><br \/>\n<img alt=\"Creating Secret\" src=\"\/images\/1476818650580676da89fee.png\" \/>\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\n        Next, we will set the <b>Access Policies <\/b> to provide access to the user under the context of which the template will be deployed. This is the user which will be accessing the Key Vault. Go to Key Vault settings and select Access Policies. Add the new user as shown below:\n<br \/><br \/>\n<img alt=\"Access Policies\" src=\"\/images\/14768190995806789bad0c4.png\" \/>\n<br \/><br \/>\n\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\n        Next, we will set the <b>Advanced Access Policies <\/b> to indicate that this key vault can be accessed via ARM Templates. Go to Key Vault settings and select Advanced Access Policies. Ensure that the checkbox for \"<i>Enable access to Azure Resource Manager for template deployment<\/i>\" is checked as shown below:\n<br \/><br \/>\n<img alt=\"Access Policies\" src=\"\/images\/1476819105580678a1cfc9f.png\" \/>\n<br \/> <br \/>\n\n    <\/li>\n\n<\/ol>\n<p>We are now all set with our Key Vault. Next, we will be using the secret we created to set the local Administrator user's password.<\/p>\n<h3>Using the Key Vault Secret in ARM Template<\/h3>\n<p>Let us assume that you have a JSON ARM Template which deploys a VM. One of the parameters in this template is AdminPassword. You want to use the Key Vault Secret to provide the value for this parameter. <\/p>\n<p><strong>First<\/strong>, ensure that the parameter is declared as <i>securestring<\/i> as shown below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"adminPassword\": {\n    \"type\": \"securestring\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n        \"description\": \"Password for local admin account.\"\n    }\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><strong>Next<\/strong>, we need to use the parameters file for this template. If you don't have one already create a new one. We can provide the reference to the Key Vault Secret as the value of admin user's password parameter in this file. General Syntax of providing reference is as shown follow:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"adminPassword\": {\n  \"reference\": {\n    \"keyVault\": {\n      \"id\": \"Key Vault Id Here\"\n    },\n    \"secretName\": \"Name of the secret in Azure Key Vault\"\n  }\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now the ID in the above Syntax can be provided as:<\/p>\n<p><em>\/subscriptions\/{guid}\/resourceGroups\/{group-name}\/providers\/Microsoft.KeyVault\/vaults\/{vault-name}<\/em>. <\/p>\n<p>Note to replace the <em>{guid}<\/em> with actual GUID for the subscription (without the curly braces), replace <em>{group-name}<\/em> with the actual name of the resource group and <em>{vault-name}<\/em> with the actual name of the Key Vault.<\/p>\n<p>You can also find the Resource ID for the Key Vault by navigating to it in the Azure Portal and then checking it's properties as shown below:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/images\/147682308858068830f2f8e.png\" alt=\"Key Vault Resource ID\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The complete parameter file looks like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n  \"$schema\": \"http:\/\/schema.management.azure.com\/schemas\/2015-01-01\/deploymentParameters.json#\",\n  \"contentVersion\": \"1.0.0.0\",\n  \"parameters\": {\n    \"OtherParameter\": {\n      \"value\": \"otherValue\"\n    },\n    \"adminPassword\": {\n      \"reference\": {\n        \"keyVault\": {\n          \"id\": \"\/subscriptions\/11111aaa-1a11-1a11-a1aa-1a1111a111a1\/resourceGroups\/TestRG101\/providers\/Microsoft.KeyVault\/vaults\/TestKeyVault101\"\n        },\n        \"secretName\": \"DefaultAdminPasswordSecret\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Next, deploy the template using PowerShell and pass this parameters file as explained here: <a href=\"\/post\/step-by-step-arm-templates-deploying-template-using-azure-powershell\/\">Deploying Template Using Azure PowerShell<\/a>. <\/p>\n<p>Example PowerShell cmdlet to deploy will look like:<\/p>\n<pre><code>New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateFile .\\TemplateFile.json -TemplateParameterFile .\\ParametersFile.json<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now that you know how to use values from Key Vaults, you can make the automated deployment of resources more secure in your environment.<\/p>",

Using this web application you can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Either visualize your own developed template,<\/li>\n<li>Or inspect existing templates on GitHub<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let's take a quick tour of the interface:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/images\/14768067785806487ad77dd.png\" alt=\"ARMVIZ Interface\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I have numbered various elements of the interface in the above diagram. Let's quickly review these elements:<\/p>\n<ol>\n\n    <li>\n              <b>Designer<\/b> - This is represented by an \"eye\" icon on the left bar. This should be selected by default. If you are in the editor mode then you can click this and the diagram will be shown in the middle portion of the screen.\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\n              <b>Editor<\/b> - This is represented by \"<\/>\" text for code on the left bar. Clicking on this will take you to the editor portion of the ARMVIZ tool. In this area, you can edit your template while still in the tool. You can add or remove components. You can even edit the components or add dependencies.\n    <\/li>\n\n     <li>\n              <b>Canvas area<\/b> - This is the main screen (the middle area) where the template is displayed.\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\n              <b>File Menu<\/b> - This is the main and simple menu in the whole web application in the top bar. It has two options:\n              <ol type=\"a\">\n                       <li>\n                             <b>Open Local Template<\/b> - You can open an ARM Template JSON from your local computer to visualize using this menu option.\n                       <\/li>\n                       <li>\n                             <b>Download Template<\/b> - You can download the current template by using this menu option.\n                       <\/li>\n              <\/ol>\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\n              <b>Quickstart ARM Templates<\/b> - This is the link to external library of Quickstart ARM Templates on GitHub. These starter templates can help you save a lot of time. Instead of starting from scratch you can use these templates to fasten the ARM Templates Development.\n    <\/li>\n\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is how the Editor portion of the tool looks like. Use this area to edit or update your template.\n<strong>Note:<\/strong> If there will be mistakes, such as missing parenthesis in your template, the designer will not show any diagram. <\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/images\/147680732358064a9ba1310.png\" alt=\"Editor Area\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can zoom into and zoom out of your template diagram by rolling the mouse wheel. You can also drag and reposition various elements.\nTake a screenshot once you have repositioned the elements as per your requirements and have zoomed into an appropriate level.<\/p>\n<p>Below screenshot is taken from a much more complex template.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"\/images\/1476806791580648877fed3.png\" alt=\"Complex ARM Template Diagram\" \/><\/p>\n<p>In conclusion, ARMVIZ can enable you to easily visualize your ARM Templates. It can empower you to generate diagrams for your documentation and to present to your team.<\/p>",

This is the construct which when defined indicates that this resource needs to be looped over and created multiple times. It also specifies the number of times to iterate via &quot;count&quot; property.<\/li>\n<li><strong>copyIndex()<\/strong> - Used to access the current iteration value. Its value for the first iteration is <strong>zero<\/strong>. For the second iteration, its value is 1 and so on... You can pass it an integer (number) as a parameter. Whatever number you pass that will become the value for the first iteration and subsequent iterations. E.g. copyIndex(20) will compute to 20 in the first iteration, 21 in the second iteration and so on.<\/li>\n<li><strong>length<\/strong> - This is the method of arrays. It computes the number of elements in an array. It can be used to set the &quot;count&quot; property of &quot;copy&quot; construct.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> Arrays are always <strong>zero indexed<\/strong>. What that means is that the first element of the array is indexed at 0, the second element of the array is indexed at 1, and so on...<\/p>\n<h3>1. Simple Example<\/h3>\n<p>Let us understand these constructs using an example.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"parameters\": { \n  \"count\": { \n    \"type\": \"int\", \n    \"defaultValue\": 3 \n  } \n}, \n\"resources\": [ \n  { \n      \"name\": \"[concat('HarvestingClouds-', copyIndex(100))]\", \n      \"type\": \"Microsoft.Web\/sites\", \n      \"location\": \"Central US\", \n      \"apiVersion\": \"2015-08-01\",\n      \"copy\": { \n         \"name\": \"websitescopy\", \n         \"count\": \"[parameters('count')]\" \n      }, \n      \"properties\": {\n          \"serverFarmId\": \"hostingPlanName\"\n      }\n  } \n]<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The above example will <strong>result<\/strong> in creation of below 3 web apps in Azure:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>HarvestingClouds-100<\/li>\n<li>HarvestingClouds-101<\/li>\n<li>HarvestingClouds-102<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note the usage of &quot;copy&quot; property in the above code example:<\/p>\n<pre><code> \"copy\": { \n             \"name\": \"websitescopy\", \n             \"count\": \"[parameters('count')]\" \n          }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>As you can notice above, the value of this property is another JSON object. This object has further two properties: <\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First is the name property, which provides the name to the looping construct. This can be any meaningful name. <\/li>\n<li>The second property is the count, which specifies how many times this resource definition should be deployed. Note that the value is set to the parameter named &quot;count&quot;. The name of the parameter can be anything but the value of the parameter has to be a number (i.e. an integer).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Next, note how the name of the web application is constructed using the copyIndex() helper function.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"name\": \"[concat('HarvestingClouds-', copyIndex(100))]\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The above value uses two helper functions. First is the &quot;concat()&quot; which is concatenating (i.e. joining) two values. First value is the prefix string &quot;HarvestingClouds-&quot;. Second parameter and the second helper function is <code>copyIndex(100)<\/code>. This specifies the current iteration value, which is offset with 100. So for the first iteration, the value will be 0+100 = 100, for the second iteration the value will be 1+100 = 101 and so on...<\/p>\n<h3>2. Example with an Array<\/h3>\n<p>Let's assume that you want to deploy multiple web apps for different purposes. You need one web app for Production, one for Staging or testing and one for Development. You want to name the web apps deployed with the purpose concatenated.\nThe below example uses an array to set the values for the web app name:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"parameters\": { \n  \"purpose\": { \n     \"type\": \"array\", \n         \"defaultValue\": [ \n         \"Production\", \n         \"Staging\", \n         \"Development\" \n      ] \n  }\n}, \n\"resources\": [ \n  { \n      \"name\": \"[concat('HarvestingClouds-', parameters('purpose')[copyIndex()])]\", \n      \"type\": \"Microsoft.Web\/sites\", \n      \"location\": \"Central US\", \n      \"apiVersion\": \"2015-08-01\",\n      \"copy\": { \n         \"name\": \"websitescopy\", \n         \"count\": \"[length(parameters('purpose'))]\" \n      }, \n      \"properties\": {\n          \"serverFarmId\": \"hostingPlanName\"\n      } \n  } \n]<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The <strong>output<\/strong> of the above sample will be 3 web apps deployed in Azure with following names:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>HarvestingClouds-Production<\/li>\n<li>HarvestingClouds-Staging<\/li>\n<li>HarvestingClouds-Development<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note in the above code sample that the parameter &quot;purpose&quot; is an array with 3 values i.e. Production, Staging, and Development. Then in the &quot;copy&quot; construct the count property is set using the length of this array as shown below. As there are 3 elements in the array, the value of count will be 3 and the resource will be deployed 3 times.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"count\": \"[length(parameters('purpose'))]\" <\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Next, the name of the web app is set using the copyIndex() and the array itself as shown below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"name\": \"[concat('HarvestingClouds-', parameters('purpose')[copyIndex()])]\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>As earlier, it uses concat helper function to add two strings. The first string is simple text i.e. &quot;HarvestingClouds-&quot;, which becomes the prefix for the web app name. Second is finding out the value of the array based on the current iteration. For the first iteration, copyIndex() will compute to zero, therefore the second parameter becomes <code>parameters('purpose')[0]<\/code>. This will fetch the 0th element of the array which is Production. Similarly, for the second iteration, copyIndex() will compute to 1, therefore the second parameter becomes <code>parameters('purpose')[1]<\/code>. This will fetch the second element of the array (or element at index value 1) which is Staging, and so on...<\/p>\n<h3>3. Depending upon resources being deployed by the copy Loop<\/h3>\n<p>Let's assume you want to deploy a storage account. But you want to deploy it only after all the web apps are deployed by the loop. In this scenario, the dependsOn property of a resource is set to the name of the &quot;copy&quot; property of the resource, rather than the resource itself.<\/p>\n<pre><code>    {\n        \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\n        \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts\",\n        \"name\": \"teststorage101\",\n        \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"accountType\": \"Standard_LRS\"\n         }\n       \"dependsOn\": [\"websitescopy\"]\n    }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Note above that the dependsOn property is set to the name property of the copy in the earlier web app example. This storage account will not be deployed until all 3 web apps are not deployed.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Limitations<\/h3>\n<p>There are two limitations on the use of the copy to iterate and create multiple resource instances:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Nested Resources<\/strong> - You cannot use a copy loop for a nested resource. If you need to create multiple instances of a resource that you typically define as nested within another resource, you must instead create the resource as a top-level resource and define the relationship with the parent resource through the <strong>type<\/strong> and <strong>name<\/strong> properties.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Looping Properties of a Resource<\/strong> - You can only use copy on resource types, not on properties within a resource type. E.g. Creating multiple data disks within a VM.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>That is all there is to iterate and creating multiple resources from a single definition. When your templates will start becoming complex then these constructs\/helper functions will help you a lot. E.g. you may need to deploy multiple load balanced resources, then you can use the concepts defined in this post.<\/p>\n<p>You can also refer the official documentation here: <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/documentation\/articles\/resource-group-create-multiple\/\">copy, copyIndex, and length<\/a><\/p>",

Just follow the below steps.<\/p>\n<ol>\n\n    <li>\nEither go to the Solution Explorer -> Right Click on the project and select \"Deploy -> New Deployment\" as shown below:<br \/>\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578624957f6b6090d5eb.png\" alt=\"New Deployment - Solution Explorer\" \/><br \/>\n\nOr you can go to the menu option Project -> Deploy -> New Deployment as shown below:<br \/>\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578624157f6b601b647b.png\" alt=\"New Deployment - Project Menu\" \/>\n\n<br \/>\nOnce you click on the \"New Deployment\", you will be presented with the below Dialog for the deployment.<br \/>\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578742957f6baa5bfb1c.png\" alt=\"New Deployment Dialog\" \/><br \/>\n\nIf you are not logged in then it will ask you to log into your Azure account. <br \/>\n\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\nIn the Dialog for \"Deploy to Resource Group\" select the Subscription by clicking on the first drop down.<br \/>\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\nNext click on the drop down for the Resource Group. You can either select an existing Resource Group or you can click on \"<Create New...>\" option to create a new resource group for the current deployment.\n<br \/>\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578768757f6bba7dd5ec.png\" alt=\"Resource Group creation\" \/>\n<br \/>\nIf you click on \"<Create New...>\" option to create a new Resource Group then you will be presented with an additional popup.\n<br \/>\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578794457f6bca893e66.png\" alt=\"Resource Group creation additional Popup\" \/><br \/>\nIn this additional popup, type the name for your new resoruce group and the location in Azure where this should be created. Click \"Create\" once done in the additional popup. <br \/><br \/>\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\nNext, we are going to provide the value for the parameters. Go ahead and click on the \"Edit Parameters...\" link in the \"Deploy to Resource Group\" dialog. This will open another popup to provide the parameters. <br \/>\nButton to edit parameters is shown below:<br \/>\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578820657f6bdae623f9.png\" alt=\"Edit Parameters\" \/> <br \/>\n\nAdditional dialog to provide parameters is shown below: <br \/>\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578821157f6bdb3ec989.png\" alt=\"Providing Parameters\" \/> <br \/>\n\nNote the following points in the parameters:\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>Corresponding to the string parameters, a text box is provided.<\/li>\n<li>For the secure string parameters like password, a secure password text box is provided.<\/li>\n<li>Corresponding to the parameters for which you have defined the \"Allowed Values\" in your template, a combo box (or drop Down) is provided with the \"default Value\" selected by default.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n Click Ok once done\n   <\/li>\n\n    <li>\nNext, click on the Deploy button to deploy the template to Azure.\n    <\/li>\n\n    <li>\nYou can check the results in the <b>Outputs<\/b> window in the Visual Studio. Along with time stamp, it will show you what steps Visual Studio took to perform the deployment. It uses the values of parameters you provided and uses the PowerShell script to deploy the resources. You will notice the PowerShell window opening and prompt for the Admin Password. \n<br \/>\n<b>Note 1: <\/b>The PowerShell window may not come above as active window. Just search and click on the window in your Taskbar. <br \/>\nProvide the password and hit Enter as shown below:\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578930357f6c1f7c0b65.png\" alt=\"PowerShell window\" \/> <br \/>\n<br \/>\n<b>Note 2: <\/b>It may take some time to complete the deployment after that. Wait and do not close the PowerShell window. It should automatically close once done.\n<br \/>\n<b>Note 3: <\/b>Once the deployment completes the last line in Output window in Visual Studio will be: \"Successfully deployed template...\" as shown below:\n<br \/>\n<img src=\"\/images\/147578931057f6c1fecaa6a.png\" alt=\"Success - Output Window\" \/> <br \/>\n\n    <\/li>\n\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is it! Navigate to the Azure portal and validate the deployed resources in your selected resource group.<\/p>",

You can use other newer versions as well.<\/p>\n<h3>Pre-Requisites<\/h3>\n<p>You need to have Azure SDK installed to get true power of Visual Studio with Azure integration. If you don't have it already, you can install the same from here: <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/downloads\/\">Azure SDK Downloads<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Authoring First ARM Template in Visual Studio<\/h3>\n<p>Authoring with Visual Studio is very easy. <\/p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>To get started just launch the Visual Studio from the Start menu.<\/li>\n<li>Next, Create a new Project of type \"Azure Resource Group\" by navigating to Templates -> Visual C# -> Cloud <br \/><br \/>\n\n<img src=\"\/images\/147576108957f653c1768fc.png\" alt=\"New Project\" \/>\n<br \/>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<li>\n    Next, you will be presented with a dialog to \"Select Azure Template\". If you want to author from scratch then choose a Blank Template. Else select one of the starter template. For this blog, we will be using \"Windows Virtual Machine\" Template.<br \/><br \/>\n    <img src=\"\/images\/147576828457f66fdc0f0e6.png\" alt=\"Selecting Azure Template\" \/>\n    <br \/>\n<\/li>\n\n<li>\n    Project is created with various folders and files. You can explore the project in the solution explorer in Visual Studio.<br \/><br \/>\n    <img src=\"\/images\/147576986357f6760758619.png\" alt=\"Solution Explorer\" \/>\n    <br \/>\n\nLet us see what these folders and files are:\n        <ol type=\"a\">\n            <li><b>Scripts<\/b>: The single PS1 file is to create a new Resource Group and deploy the ARM Template. It uses \"New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment\" PowerShell cmdlet to deploy the template. <\/li>\n            <li><b>Templates<\/b>: \"<i>WindowsVirtualMachine.json<\/i>\" is the main ARM Template file that we are interested in. Also, \"<i>WindowsVirtualMachine.parameters.json<\/i>\" is the parameters file for the ARM template.<\/li>\n            <li><b>Tools<\/b>: This folder contains the \"AzCopy.exe\" file to help you copy any artifacts to Azure.<\/li>\n        <\/ol>\n<\/li>\n\n<li>\n    Double click and open the \"<i>WindowsVirtualMachine.json<\/i>\" file to open it. You will be presented with a huge JSON file. Collapse the section by clicking the small \"-\" signs to the left of the file. Also notice the <b>JSON Outline<\/b> panel to the left. This is your biggest friend in Visual Studio when authoring ARM Templates.<br \/><br \/>\n    <img src=\"\/images\/147577487757f6899d297b5.png\" alt=\"\" \/>\n    <br \/>\nYou can immediately notice that key sections both in the template in the middle and in the JSON Oultine panel on the left (in the image above) are:\n               <ol type=\"a\">\n                   <li>parameters<\/li>\n                   <li>variables<\/li>\n                   <li>resources<\/li>\n               <\/ol>\nYou can click on any of the elements in the left JSON Outline panel and the same section will be highlighted in the center, in the JSON template file.\n    <br \/>\n\n<\/li>\n\n<li>\n    Next, let us look at JSON Outline panel and check how it can provide us more information and help us in authoring templates.<br \/><br \/>\n    <img src=\"\/images\/147578115457f6a2226c2be.png\" alt=\"JSON Outline Panel\" \/>\n    <br \/>\n    You can see that the panel provides a special icon for each type of the resource. In our current template the various resources listed are:\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n        <li>StorageAccount<\/li>\n        <li>PublicIPAddress<\/li>\n        <li>VirtualNetwork<\/li>\n        <li>NetworkInterface<\/li>\n        <li>VirtualMachine<\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n\nClick on each of the resources and inspect how their JSON structure looks and differs. You will immediately notice that the major difference in each of these resources is in their <b>Type<\/b> and <b>Properties<\/b>.\n\n<h3>Adding New Resource<\/h3> \nLet's assume you want to add a new resource to this template. You have 2 ways to achieve the same:\n    <ol>\n    <li><b>Method 1<\/b> - Create a new resource by modifying and adding the JSON for the new resource in the template.<\/li>\n    <li><b>Method 2<\/b> - Let Visual Studio add the resource for you. Right click anywhere in the resources area of the JSON Outline Panel or the small \"+\" box at the top left of the panel (as shown in the image above) and VS will give you a new popup to add the resource from pre-defined resources as shown below.<\/li>\n    <\/ol>\n    <img src=\"\/images\/147578170157f6a4457bae0.png\" alt=\"Add Resource\" \/>\n<br \/>\nOnce you click Add the JSON for resource will be added to the template and the corresponding new element will appear in the JSON Outline Panel.\n<br \/>\n\n<h3>Deleting a Resource<\/h3> <br \/>\nIf you need to delete a resource, simply right click on that resource in the JSON outline panel on the left and then select \"Delete Resource\".\n<br \/>\n\n<h3>Using Intellisense<\/h3>     \nThe last thing to notice is the use of <b>Intellisense<\/b> in Visual Studio which helps you as you are editing the templates.<br \/><br \/>\n    <img src=\"\/images\/147578465457f6afce4debb.png\" alt=\"Intellisense\" \/>\n    <br \/>\n     When you type quotes the closing quotes are automatically provided. Also, as you can see in the above image the various valid values, that can come there are also shown along with small tooltip about the data type. If the Intellisense doesn't come up automatically, then press Ctrl + Space to get Intellisense.\n<\/li>\n\n<\/ol>\n<p>In the end, the Visual Studio makes authoring ARM templates much more manageable and easy for you.<\/p>\n<p>In the next blog, we will see how to use Visual Studio to Deploy the templates.<\/p>",

Now that you have a fully functional ARM template we want to deploy this template to Azure.<\/p>\n<p>There are various options to deploy a template to Azure. We already saw in the last blog <a href=\"\/post\/step-by-step-arm-templates-deploying-template-using-azure-portal\/\">How to deploy template using <strong>Azure Portal<\/strong><\/a>. Now we will look at <strong>Azure PowerShell<\/strong> as more programmatic and automated way to deploy the template.<\/p>\n<h2>Pre-requisites<\/h2>\n<p>Things you should know before deployment<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Azure PowerShell<\/strong> - This should be installed on the machine from where the Steps will be followed. If you don't have this then use this link to get it: <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/documentation\/articles\/powershell-install-configure\/\">Get Azure PowerShell<\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong>Azure Subscription<\/strong> - where you want to deploy your template<\/li>\n<li><strong>Resource Group<\/strong> - This is the resource group in Azure where you will be deploying your template. You can create a new resource group (for the resources that will be deployed by the template) or use an existing one.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Parameters<\/strong> - Value of the input parameters to the template should be known to you for the deployment. Follow all your naming conventions when defining the parameters for deployments of resources in Azure. <\/li>\n<li><strong>Internet Connectivity<\/strong> - This should be present on the machine from where the Steps will be followed for connectivity to Azure<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Steps for Deployment<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li>First, launch a PowerShell window as an Administrator<\/li>\n<li>Then, log into the Azure account. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Run the below cmdlet to log into Azure:<\/p>\n<pre><code>Add-AzureRmAccount<\/code><\/pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Select appropriate Azure Subscription<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You have two choices here. You can either use below cmdlet to use Subscription ID<\/p>\n<pre><code>Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionID &lt;YourSubscriptionId&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Or you can use the Subscription name with the below cmdlet:<\/p>\n<pre><code>Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName \"&lt;Your Subscription Name&gt;\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Next, if you already have a resource group to which you want to deploy the template then skip this step. Else create a new resource group. A resource in Azure ARM architecture can only exist in a resource group. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use below cmdlet to create a new Resource Group:<\/p>\n<pre><code>New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name TestResourceGroup01 -Location \"Central US\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Before deploying the Resource Template to Azure, you should Test it. This step is optional but highly recommended.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Use the below cmdlet to test and validate your template:<\/p>\n<pre><code>Test-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateFile &lt;PathToJsonTemplate&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Now comes the last step i.e. to deploy the template. You have two options when deploying the template. You can either deploy a template without any parameters (if none are required) or you need to specify the parameters. Let's check both these options next.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Deploying Template which doesn't need Parameters<\/h3>\n<p>You can deploy such template using <code>New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment<\/code> cmdlet.\nIf the template file is on a local directory then use the below cmdlet:<\/p>\n<pre><code>New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateFile &lt;PathToTemplate&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>If the template file is uploaded to some hosted location and is accessible via a link, then use the below cmdlet to deploy the template:<\/p>\n<pre><code>New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateUri &lt;LinkToTemplate&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>Deploying Template with Parameters<\/h3>\n<p>Deploying of the template is exactly similar as the previous section. You use the same cmdlet. To specify the parameter, you have 4 options. Use the below cmdlets for the option you want to use.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Option 1<\/strong> - Using Inline Parameter<\/p>\n<pre><code>New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateFile &lt;PathToTemplate&gt; -myParameterName \"parameterValue\" -secondParameterName \"secondParameterValue\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><strong>Option 2<\/strong> - Using Parameter Object<\/p>\n<pre><code>$parameters = @{\"&lt;ParameterName&gt;\"=\"&lt;Parameter Value&gt;\"}\nNew-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateFile &lt;PathToTemplate&gt; -TemplateParameterObject $parameters<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><strong>Option 3<\/strong> - Using Parameter file which is in local environment<\/p>\n<pre><code>New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateFile &lt;PathToTemplate&gt; -TemplateParameterFile &lt;PathToParameterFile&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><strong>Option 4<\/strong> - Using Parameter file which is located externally and can be referenced via Link<\/p>\n<pre><code>New-AzureRmResourceGroupDeployment -Name ExampleDeployment -ResourceGroupName TestResourceGroup01 -TemplateUri &lt;LinkToTemplate&gt; -TemplateParameterUri &lt;LinkToParameterFile&gt;<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>Key Gotchas<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>If you provide values for a parameter in both the local parameter file and inline, the inline value takes precedence.<\/li>\n<li>You cannot use inline parameters with an external parameter file. All inline parameters are ignored when you specify &quot;TemplateParameterUri&quot; parameter.<\/li>\n<li>As a best practice, do not store sensitive infomation in the parameters file e.g. Local admin password. Instead either provide these dynamically using inline parameters. Or store them using the Azure Key vault and then reference the key vault in your parameters file.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You can find more details about these cmdlets here: <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/documentation\/articles\/resource-group-template-deploy\/#deploy-with-powershell\">Deploy resources with Resource Manager templates and Azure PowerShell<\/a><\/p>\n<p>In the next blog, we will see how to create a Parameters File for providing parameters dynamically to the template.<\/p>",

We will be looking at using Visual Studio to author ARM templates in a future blog post. Visual Studio can provide JSON outlining and is a very powerful tool for authoring ARM templates.<\/p>\n<p>Let us assume that you want to deploy a storage account and build a virtual network in Azure. You want to automate the process and need to repeat the process in various environments. ARM templates fit the bill for the solution of this problem.<\/p>\n<p>In the next few sections, we will build each section of the template and then at the end will check the complete template.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Template Header<\/h3>\n<p>This section is very basic and contains just the schema and the content version. You can use the content version to manage the development versions of the template as you make changes to your templates in the future.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"$schema\": \"https:\/\/schema.management.azure.com\/schemas\/2015-01-01\/deploymentTemplate.json#\",\n\"contentVersion\": \"1.0.0.0\",<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>2. Parameters<\/h3>\n<p>Here we define all the inputs we need from the end users. We provide default values for those parameters for which we know what the most common values will be based on our environment. For the current template we define two parameters:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>vhdStorageName<\/strong> - This is the name of the storage account in Azure which will be created by the deployment of this template.<\/li>\n<li><strong>virtualNetworkName<\/strong> - This is the name of the Virtual Network which will be created by the deployment of this template.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>As a best practice, provide the metadata, describing what each parameter is for. Also, note that we have used pascal casing to name the parameters with very descriptive names.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"parameters\": {\n    \"vhdStorageName\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"minLength\": 1,\n        \"defaultValue\": \"mystorage101\",\n        \"metadata\": {\n            \"description\": \"Name of the Storage Account.\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"virtualNetworkName\": {\n        \"type\": \"string\",\n        \"metadata\": {\n            \"description\": \"Name of the virtual network.\"\n        }\n    }\n},<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>3. Variables<\/h3>\n<p>Next, we add some variables for the values which will be reused later in the template in the resources section. We create variables for all those reusable values for which we know what their value at deployment will be. We define 4 variables in this template:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>addressPrefix<\/strong> - Address prefix for the Virtual Network <\/li>\n<li><strong>subnetName<\/strong> - Subnet name which will be created under the virtual network<\/li>\n<li><strong>subnetPrefix<\/strong> - Subnet prefix for the subnet, which will be created under the virtual network<\/li>\n<li><strong>vhdStorageType<\/strong> - Type of the storage account. Here we used Standard locally redundant storage (LRS)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Variables section look as below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"variables\": {\n    \"addressPrefix\": \"10.0.0.0\/16\",\n    \"subnetName\": \"Subnet\",\n    \"subnetPrefix\": \"10.0.0.0\/24\",\n    \"vhdStorageType\": \"Standard_LRS\"\n},<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>4. Resources<\/h3>\n<p>Now comes the last and main section i.e. Resources. Here we define both the resources for our template:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Storage Account<\/li>\n<li>Virtual Network<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Let us look at each of these resources one by one.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A. Storage Account Resource<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This resource has below properties (or key-value pairs):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Type<\/strong> - Type of the resource is set to Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts. This is what tells the Azure that the current resource is a Storage Account<\/li>\n<li><strong>Name<\/strong> - This defines the name of the storage account to be deployed based on the parameter to the template<\/li>\n<li><strong>API Version<\/strong> - this is the standard version for the REST API in Azure<\/li>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong> - This is the Azure location. The location is found dynamically based on the location of the resource group to which this template will be deployed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>tags<\/strong> - only one tag is defined for the display name. You should have more tags in case of a production ready template<\/li>\n<li><strong>properties<\/strong> - This is where you tell Azure what kind of storage account you need. Here the account type is set using the value of the variable vhdStorageType.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><strong>B. Virtual Network Resource<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This resource has below properties (or key-value pairs):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Type<\/strong> - Type of the resource is set to Microsoft.Network\/virtualNetworks. This is what tells the Azure that the current resource is a Virtual Network<\/li>\n<li><strong>Name<\/strong> - This defines the name of the virtual network to be deployed based on the parameter to the template<\/li>\n<li><strong>API Version<\/strong> - this is the standard version for the REST API in Azure<\/li>\n<li><strong>Location<\/strong> - This is the Azure location. The location is found dynamically based on the location of the resource group to which this template will be deployed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>tags<\/strong> - only one tag is defined for the display name. You should have more tags in case of a production ready template<\/li>\n<li><strong>properties<\/strong> - This is where you define the address space for the virtual network. You also define the subnet under the virtual network here.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The resources section look like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"resources\": [\n    {\n        \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts\",\n        \"name\": \"[parameters('vhdStorageName')]\",\n        \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\n        \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\n        \"tags\": {\n            \"displayName\": \"StorageAccount\"\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"accountType\": \"[variables('vhdStorageType')]\"\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\n        \"type\": \"Microsoft.Network\/virtualNetworks\",\n        \"name\": \"[parameters('virtualNetworkName')]\",\n        \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\n        \"tags\": {\n            \"displayName\": \"VirtualNetwork\"\n        },\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"addressSpace\": {\n                \"addressPrefixes\": [\n                    \"[variables('addressPrefix')]\"\n                ]\n            },\n            \"subnets\": [\n                {\n                    \"name\": \"[variables('subnetName')]\",\n                    \"properties\": {\n                        \"addressPrefix\": \"[variables('subnetPrefix')]\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n]<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>Complete Template<\/h3>\n<p>Here is the complete template build from all the sections discussed above.

These constructs reduce the hard coded values in your templates. You can use the information from this blog to make your existing templates more dynamic and start writing new templates with a much generic approach.<\/p>\n<p>Let's look at the most important helper functions and their practical usage one by one. <\/p>\n<h3>1. Resource Id - Resource Function<\/h3>\n<p>You use this function to determine the ID of a resource. This is only used when the resource (whose ID is needed) is not being deployed in the current template and it already exists in Azure.<\/p>\n<p>The generic syntax to use this is:<\/p>\n<pre><code>resourceId ([subscriptionId], [resourceGroupName], resourceType, resourceName1, [resourceName2]...)<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Only required parameters of this helper function are resourceType and resourceName1.<\/p>\n<p>These parameters are as follows:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>subscription ID - This is only needed if you want to refer a different subscription. Default value is the current subscription<\/li>\n<li>resource Group Name - Name of the resource group where the resource exists. Default is the current resource group, in which you are deploying the template<\/li>\n<li>resource Type - Type of resource including resource provider namespace<\/li>\n<li>resource Name 1  - Name of the resource<\/li>\n<li>resource Name 2  - Next resource name segment if resource is nested. E.g. a VM Extension<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Example<\/strong><\/p>\n<pre><code>\"vnetId1\": \"[resourceId('AE06-Mgmt-RG','Microsoft.Network\/virtualNetworks', parameters('virtualNetworkName'))]\",\n\"vnetId2\": \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network\/virtualNetworks', variables('virtualNetworkName'))]\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The above example shows two ways of using the resource ID helper function to determine the Id of a virtual network. First one uses the resource group, resource type and resource name. Second example uses only the resource Type and resource name. Second example assumes the resource group to be same as the template being deployed to.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Resource Group - Resource Function<\/h3>\n<p>This helper function returns an object that represents the current resource group to which the template is being deployed.<\/p>\n<p>The generic syntax to use this is:<\/p>\n<pre><code>resourceGroup()<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>No parameters are needed in this helper function.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Example<\/strong><\/p>\n<pre><code>\"vhdStorageName\": \"[concat('vhdstorage', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]\",\n \"storageAccountResourceGroup\": \"[resourcegroup().name]\",\n \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The above example shows 3 uses of the resource group helper functions. First one uses the ID of the resource group, second uses the name property and third uses the location for the current resource group.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Subscription - Resource Function<\/h3>\n<p>The generic syntax to use this is:<\/p>\n<pre><code>subscription()<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>No parameters are needed in this helper function.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Example<\/strong><\/p>\n<pre><code>\"subscriptionId\": \"[subscription().subscriptionId]\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The above example is straightforward. It fetches the subscription Id of the current subscription.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Concat - String Function<\/h3>\n<p>This function is used to concatinate (i.e. combine) two or more values.<\/p>\n<p>The generic syntax to use this is:<\/p>\n<pre><code>concat (array1, array2, array3, ...)<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>At least 1 array is needed for concat to work. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Example<\/strong><\/p>\n<pre><code>\"subnetRef\": \"[concat(variables('vNetId'), '\/subnets\/', variables('subnetName'))]\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The above example combines (or concatinates) 3 text values. First value is the value of variable vNetId. Second value is a string &quot;\/subnets\/&quot;. Third value is the value of the variable subnet Name.<\/p>\n<p>These are the most common Helper functions that you will use in 80%-90% of the templates. <\/p>\n<p>To check the complete list of Helper Functions, check this official link: <a href=\"https:\/\/azure.microsoft.com\/en-us\/documentation\/articles\/resource-group-template-functions\/#resource-functions\">Azure Resource Manager template functions<\/a><\/p>",

You can deploy a new Storage Account, new Virtual Network and three Virtual Machines in that virtual network within a single template.\nWithin the object, various properties (and nested properties) are used to provide the configurations of each resource. <\/p>\n<h3>Elements<\/h3>\n<p>Different elements in a single resource object can be one of the following:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>apiVersion<\/strong> - <strong><em>Required<\/em><\/strong> - Version of the API. e.g. &quot;2015-06-15&quot;<\/li>\n<li><strong>type<\/strong> - <strong><em>Required<\/em><\/strong> - Type of the resource. This value is a combination of the namespace of the resource provider and the resource type that the resource provider supports. e.g. Azure Storage Account will have type as &quot;Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts&quot;.<\/li>\n<li><strong>name<\/strong> - <strong><em>Required<\/em><\/strong> - Name of the resource. The name must follow URI component restrictions and also the Azure naming restrictions if any. E.g. Storage account name can only be in small letters and has to be unique.<\/li>\n<li><strong>location<\/strong> - Optional - Use supported geo-locations of the provided resource without any spaces. Or use the resource group's location dynamically.<\/li>\n<li><strong>tags<\/strong> - Optional - Tags that are associated with the resource.<\/li>\n<li><strong>dependsOn<\/strong> - Optional - Other resources in the same template, that the current resource being defined depends on. The dependencies between resources are evaluated and resources are deployed in their dependent order. When resources are not dependent on each other, they are attempted to be deployed in parallel. The value can be a comma-separated list of resource names or resource unique identifiers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>properties<\/strong> - Optional - Resource specific configuration settings. E.g. Account type property for a storage account name.<\/li>\n<li><strong>resources<\/strong> - Optional - Child resources that depend on the resource being defined. E.g. Extension resources for a Virtual Machine resource.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>Examples<\/h3>\n<p>Let's look at two examples. First, we will take a simple resource example to deploy a storage account in Azure:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n            \"type\": \"Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts\",\n            \"name\": \"[variables('vhdStorageName')]\",\n            \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\n            \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\n            \"tags\": {\n                \"displayName\": \"StorageAccount\",\n                \"department\" : \"Finance\",\n                \"application\" : \"database\"\n            },\n            \"properties\": {\n                \"accountType\": \"[variables('vhdStorageType')]\"\n            }\n        }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Above example will deploy a storage account with the name from &quot;vhdStorageName&quot; variable. It will apply 3 tags to the resource after deployment. It will use the account type (i.e. standard or premium) based on the value of the &quot;vhdStorageType&quot; variable. If you want to deploy 2 or more similar storage accounts, then just copy and paste the json for the resource, separated by comma. It will become another object in the Resources array.<\/p>\n<p>Now let's look at a complex and larger example of deploying a single virtual machine with one extension for Diagnostics.<\/p>\n<pre><code>    {\n        \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\n        \"type\": \"Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\",\n        \"name\": \"[variables('vmName')]\",\n        \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\n        \"tags\": {\n            \"displayName\": \"VirtualMachine\"\n        },\n        \"dependsOn\": [\n            \"[concat('Microsoft.Storage\/storageAccounts\/', variables('vhdStorageName'))]\",\n            \"[concat('Microsoft.Network\/networkInterfaces\/', variables('nicName'))]\"\n        ],\n        \"properties\": {\n            \"hardwareProfile\": {\n                \"vmSize\": \"[variables('vmSize')]\"\n            },\n            \"osProfile\": {\n                \"computerName\": \"[variables('vmName')]\",\n                \"adminUsername\": \"[parameters('adminUsername')]\",\n                \"adminPassword\": \"[parameters('adminPassword')]\"\n            },\n            \"storageProfile\": {\n                \"imageReference\": {\n                    \"publisher\": \"[variables('imagePublisher')]\",\n                    \"offer\": \"[variables('imageOffer')]\",\n                    \"sku\": \"[parameters('windowsOSVersion')]\",\n                    \"version\": \"latest\"\n                },\n                \"osDisk\": {\n                    \"name\": \"osdisk\",\n                    \"vhd\": {\n                        \"uri\": \"[concat('http:\/\/', variables('vhdStorageName'), '.blob.core.windows.net\/', variables('vhdStorageContainerName'), '\/', variables('OSDiskName'), '.vhd')]\"\n                    },\n                    \"caching\": \"ReadWrite\",\n                    \"createOption\": \"FromImage\"\n                }\n            },\n            \"networkProfile\": {\n                \"networkInterfaces\": [\n                    {\n                        \"id\": \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network\/networkInterfaces', variables('nicName'))]\"\n                    }\n                ]\n            },\n            \"diagnosticsProfile\": {\n                \"bootDiagnostics\": {\n                    \"enabled\": true,\n                    \"storageUri\": \"[concat('http:\/\/', variables('diagnosticsStorageAccountName'), '.blob.core.windows.net')]\"\n                }\n            }\n        },\n        \"resources\": [\n            {\n                \"type\": \"extensions\",\n                \"name\": \"Microsoft.Insights.VMDiagnosticsSettings\",\n                \"apiVersion\": \"2015-06-15\",\n                \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\n                \"tags\": {\n                    \"displayName\": \"AzureDiagnostics\"\n                },\n                \"dependsOn\": [\n                    \"[concat('Microsoft.Compute\/virtualMachines\/', variables('vmName'))]\"\n                ],\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"publisher\": \"Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics\",\n                    \"type\": \"IaaSDiagnostics\",\n                    \"typeHandlerVersion\": \"1.5\",\n                    \"autoUpgradeMinorVersion\": true,\n                    \"settings\": {\n                        \"xmlCfg\": \"[base64(concat(variables('wadcfgxstart'), variables('wadmetricsresourceid'), variables('wadcfgxend')))]\",\n                        \"storageAccount\": \"[variables('diagnosticsStorageAccountName')]\"\n                    },\n                    \"protectedSettings\": {\n                        \"storageAccountName\": \"[variables('diagnosticsStorageAccountName')]\",\n                        \"storageAccountKey\": \"[listkeys(variables('accountid'), '2015-06-15').key1]\",\n                        \"storageAccountEndPoint\": \"https:\/\/core.windows.net\"\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        ]\n    }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Note that the above code snippet defines a single virtual machine. Let us decode various sections of this complex resource:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It begins with simple properties like apiVersion, type, name, location and tags as discussed in the previous example. These are straightforward and thus values are provided to these attributes.<\/li>\n<li>Next is the <strong>dependsOn<\/strong> section. This defines the dependency between resources. In the above example, the virtual machine resource is dependent on the storage account and a network interface, which are also defined in the template. These 2 resources will be created before the virtual machine creation\/deployment. If these resources are not created in the template then it will check for the presence of these resources in the current subscription. If they are not present the template will not get deployed and will error out.<\/li>\n<li>Next are various <strong>properties<\/strong> to configure the Virtual machine, like hardware profile, os profile, storage profile, os disk, network profile, diagnostics profile etc.<\/li>\n<li>Next, we have additional <strong>sub-resources<\/strong>. These are Azure resources which will be created and linked to the current resource. Only one sub-resource is created in the above example which is an extension for VM diagnostics settings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That's all there is to Resources in ARM Templates.

These variables can then be reused at multiple locations in the resources section. If you later want to change the value of a variable then it automatically gets updated at all other locations. They can be used to define a resource property.<\/p>\n<h3>Defining Variables<\/h3>\n<p>Variable is a one huge JSON object. Each property can be one of the simple data type (like integer, bool, string etc.) or can be another complex JSON object. The general structure is as shown below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"variables\": {\n      \"variable 1\" : \"value 1\",\n      \"variable 2\" : \"value 2\",\n      \"variable 3\" : 1024,\n      \"variable 4\" : {}\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Note that in the above example, the first 3 variables are of simple value type. The 4rth variable is however of a complex JSON object type.<\/p>\n<p>Let's now check a real variables section from an actual ARM template:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"variables\": {\n        \"vmSize\": \"Standard_A2\",\n        \"virtualNetworkName\": \"MyVNETName\",\n        \"vnetId1\": \"[resourceId('Microsoft.Network\/virtualNetworks', variables('virtualNetworkName'))]\",\n        \"vnetId2\": \"[resourceId(parameters('vNetRG'),'Microsoft.Network\/virtualNetworks',parameters('virtualNetworkName'))]\",\n        \"subnetRef\": \"[concat(variables('vnetId'), '\/subnets\/', variables('subnetName'))]\",\n        \"vhdStorageName\": \"[concat('vhdstorage', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]\",\n        \"storageAccountResourceGroup\": \"[resourcegroup().name]\",\n        \"location\": \"[resourceGroup().location]\",\n        \"subscriptionId\": \"[subscription().subscriptionId]\"\n    }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>There are lots of key constructs in the above code snippet. I have tried to capture as many different constructs in this snippets as I could. Let us decode each variable one by one.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>vmSize - Simple String<\/li>\n<li>virtualNetworkName - Simple string name<\/li>\n<li>vnetId1 - This uses a special function named &quot;<strong>resourceId<\/strong>&quot; to find out the resource ID of the virtual network. This function is invoked by using the syntax <code>\"[resourceId(Input)]\"<\/code> .  This gets the resource ID of a resource which is defined by the Input to this. Also, note the use of another variable as an input to this.<\/li>\n<li>vnetId2 - This also fetches the resource Id of a virtual network using &quot;resourceId&quot; method. Note the use of the value of a parameter in this to find out Resource Group of the existing Virtual network (parameter &quot;vNetRG&quot;).<\/li>\n<li>subnetRef - This variable uses another function &quot;<strong>concat<\/strong>&quot; in ARM template i.e. <code>\"[concat(input1,input2,...)]\"<\/code>. This function can take many inputs and will concatinate (i.e. club together) the value of all the inputs provided. You can use parameters or another variable.<\/li>\n<li>vhdStorageName - This also uses concat function to dynamically generate a storage name. However it uses &quot;<strong>resourcegroup<\/strong>&quot; function as <code>\"[resourcegroup()]\"<\/code>. This function always returns the resource group to which you are deploying the current ARM template. Then the variable uses the id property of the resource group returned.<\/li>\n<li>storageAccountResourceGroup - This uses the &quot;name&quot; property of the current resource group<\/li>\n<li>location - This uses the &quot;location&quot; property of the current resource group.<\/li>\n<li>subscriptionId - This uses the &quot;<strong>subscription<\/strong>&quot; function as <code>\"[subscription()]\"<\/code> to find out the current subscription to which the current ARM template is being deployed.  Then it uses the subscription Id property of the subscription to get the required Id.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Note that these constructs are very powerfull and can be used to dynamically construct your ARM template. These constructs are also known as Helper Functions and are explained in detail here: <a href=\"..\/step-by-step-arm-templates-helper-functions\/\">Step by Step ARM Templates - Helper Functions<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Using Variables<\/h3>\n<p>Using variables is very easy and is similar to using parameters. In fact, you already saw the usage of variables above, while defining other variables.<\/p>\n<p>You use the square parenthesis to indicate to the ARM engine to evaluate whatever is inside the parenthesis. You use the &quot;variable&quot; keyword and then you pass the name of the variable as input. Check the example below.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"storageAccountName\": \"[variables('storageAccountName')]\"<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>Best Practices<\/h3>\n<p>Best practices are similar to the Parameters.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provide complete descriptive names, no matter how long.<\/li>\n<li>Use <strong>Pascal Casing<\/strong> to name your parameters. i.e. First letter should be a small letter. Then every new word will have the first letter as a capital. No space between words. E.g. storageAccountName<\/li>\n<li>Use the constructs explained in the previous section to dynamically generate variables. This reduces any human errors.<\/li>\n<li>Anything that is used more than once and is not required to be entered by an end user, should be created as a variable. Later on, this helps by minimizing the number of places you need to change the value.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That's all there is to Variables in ARM Templates.

These parameters are the end-user inputs for various aspects of the template. E.g. If you are deploying an Azure Virtual Machine via an ARM Template then the name of the VM can be an input parameter. Operating System type can be another parameter.<\/p>\n<p>The parameters can be referred and used in other parts of the ARM Template.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Defining Parameters<\/h3>\n<p>Parameters is a one huge JSON object with multiple JSON properties. Each property is one parameter which is represented as another JSON object. Let us look at its structure at a high level.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"parameters\": {\n               \"parameter 1\" : {},\n               \"parameter 2\" : {},\n               \"parameter 3\" : {}\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>E.g. If you are creating a template to deploy a Windows Virtual Machine then the parameters will look something like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"parameters\": {\n               \"VMName\" : {},\n               \"AdminUserName\" : {},\n               \"AdminPassword\" : {},\n               \"WindowsOSVersion\" : {}\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now let us look at one of the parameters. E.g. The AdminUserName parameter will look like:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"adminUsername\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"minLength\": 1,\n            \"metadata\": {\n                \"description\": \"Username for the Virtual Machine.\"\n            }\n        }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The parameter object, as shown above, has following parts:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Type<\/strong> - This is the data Type of the parameter.<\/li>\n<li><strong>minLength<\/strong> - This is the minimum length the parameter must have<\/li>\n<li><strong>Metadata<\/strong> - This is just to provide a description as to what the parameter means.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The <strong>Data Type<\/strong> allowed for the parameter are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>string or secureString \u2013 any valid JSON string<\/li>\n<li>int \u2013 any valid JSON integer<\/li>\n<li>bool \u2013 any valid JSON boolean <\/li>\n<li>object \u2013 any valid JSON object <\/li>\n<li>array \u2013 any valid JSON array<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A more complex parameter e.g. Windows OS Version, with few more properties, is shown below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"windowsOSVersion\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"defaultValue\": \"2012-R2-Datacenter\",\n            \"allowedValues\": [\n                \"2008-R2-SP1\",\n                \"2012-Datacenter\",\n                \"2012-R2-Datacenter\"\n            ],\n            \"metadata\": {\n                \"description\": \"The Windows version for the VM.

To understand ARM templates, you need to understand few quick basics about JSON. These will enable you to lay a great foundation which will enable you to understand ARM templates very easily.<\/p>\n<p>JSON or JavaScript Object Notation (pronounce like &quot;Jay-son&quot;) is a text-based data format that's designed to be human-readable, lightweight, and easy to transmit between a server and a web client. Its syntax is derived from JavaScript. Think of this as an even more compact version of XML files.<\/p>\n<p>JSON is a popular notation for transmitting data through RESTful web services. The official internet media type for JSON is <code>application\/json<\/code>, and JSON files typically have a <code>.json<\/code> extension.<\/p>\n<p>To understand JSON we need to understand <strong>3 main components<\/strong>. These components are like building blocks, using which you can build very complex JSON files.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Objects<\/h2>\n<p>Objects are the heart of JSON. Object denotes a real life object, e.g. an Employee. Just like a real life object, these have various properties and a value for each of these properties. E.g. An Employee will have Name property with value as John. Further, an employee object can have various another properties like Age, Salary, Department etc. So to denote an object in JSON you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One object will be represented by curly brackets. It will begin from opening curly bracket i.e. <code>{<\/code> and will end at closing curly bracket i.e. <code>}<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Denote the property and corresponding values as <code>\"key\" : \"value\"<\/code> or <code>\"property\" : \"value\"<\/code> pairs.<\/li>\n<li>You can only use double quotes for Properties as they will always be of type string<\/li>\n<li>You will have double quotes around Values if they are of string type. You will not have any quotes in case of a number or a boolean value.<\/li>\n<li>Each property will be separated from next property by a comma<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> Each JSON file is also a single JSON object. At root level it starts with an opening curly bracket i.e. <code>{<\/code> and will end with closing curly bracket i.e. <code>}<\/code>. There can't be any other objects at the root level. Think of this similar to how in an XML file there can be only one element at the root level. <\/p>\n<p>Example Employee object is shown below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"Name\" : \"John\",\n    \"Age\" : 34,\n    \"Department\" : \"Finance\",\n    \"Salary\" : \"100000\",\n    \"IsAdmin\" : true\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<h2>2. Arrays<\/h2>\n<p>Simply put, arrays are a collection of items. In JSON the <strong>square brackets<\/strong> represents an Array. E.g. An array of 3 employees will look like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>[\n  {\n        \"Name\" : \"John\",\n        \"Age\" : 34\n    },\n   {\n        \"Name\" : \"Mary\",\n        \"Age\" : 32\n    },\n   {\n        \"Name\" : \"Matthew\",\n        \"Age\" : 29\n    }\n]<\/code><\/pre>\n<h2>3. Nesting of Objects<\/h2>\n<p>Now things get more interesting with nesting of Objects. What Nesting means is that one object can have it's property as another complex object. Don't worry if that sounds confusing. Let's understand that statement using an example. An Address where a person lives can be represented by an object. This object will look like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n  \"StreetNumber\" : \"50\",\n  \"StreetName\" : \"Brian Harrison Way\",\n  \"Unit Number\" : 22,\n  \"City\" : \"Toronto\",\n  \"Country\" : \"Canada\"\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now an Employee Object will have an Address object as one of it's property (because employee need to live somewhere). This new complex Employee object will look like below, with nested Address object as one of it's property:<\/p>\n<pre><code> {\n        \"Name\" : \"John\",\n        \"Age\" : 34,\n        \"Department\" : \"Finance\",\n        \"Salary\" : \"100000\",\n        \"IsAdmin\" : true,\n        \"Address\" :   {\n                          \"StreetNumber\" : \"50\",\n                          \"StreetName\" : \"Brian Harrison Way\",\n                          \"Unit Number\" : 22,\n                          \"City\" : \"Toronto\",\n                          \"Country\" : \"Canada\"\n                       }\n    }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>That's all there is to it. Now you can use these 3 components and build very complex json files\/templates. Even the most complex template can be broken into these 3 components. <\/p>\n<p>Below is a complex example with all 3 components. <\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"Department\": \"Finance\",\n    \"TotalEmployees\": 2,\n    \"Employees\": [\n        {\n            \"Name\": \"John\",\n            \"Age\": 34,\n            \"Department\": \"Finance\",\n            \"Salary\": \"100000\",\n            \"IsAdmin\": true,\n            \"Address\": {\n                \"StreetNumber\": \"50\",\n                \"StreetName\": \"Brian Harrison Way\",\n                \"Unit Number\": 22,\n                \"City\": \"Toronto\",\n                \"Country\": \"Canada\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"Name\": \"John\",\n            \"Age\": 34,\n            \"Department\": \"Finance\",\n            \"Salary\": \"100000\",\n            \"IsAdmin\": true,\n            \"Address\": {\n                \"StreetNumber\": \"50\",\n                \"StreetName\": \"Brian Harrison Way\",\n                \"Unit Number\": 22,\n                \"City\": \"Toronto\",\n                \"Country\": \"Canada\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The above JSON object denotes one department with name as Finance and total number of employees as 2. Then the &quot;Employees&quot; object is an array of 2 emplyees. Each emplyee object further have a complex property as Address, which is another object. <\/p>\n<p>If you understood each of the 3 components, you should be able to build\/understand most complex JSON files with ease.<\/p>",

These files can then be used for any number of purposes. E.g.

Generating the context to the storage container<\/h3>\n<p>The context to the storage blob container can be created in one of the 3 ways, based on your security requirements. All methods use the <code>New-AzureStorageContext<\/code> cmdlet to generate the storage context. The methods differ on how you pass the parameters to this cmdlet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A. Via fetching the Azure Storage Key<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This first method uses the <code>Get-AzureStorageKey<\/code> to fetch the storage key. This key is then used to generate the context as shown below.<\/p>\n<pre><code>$StorageAccountName = \"yourstorageaccount\"\n$StorageAccountKey = Get-AzureStorageKey -StorageAccountName $StorageAccountName\n$Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext $StorageAccountName -StorageAccountKey $StorageAccountKey.Primary<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><strong>B. Via fetching the Azure Storage Container SAS Token<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This second method uses the <code>New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken<\/code> to create a new SAS token to securely access the storage container. This token is then used to generate the context as shown below.<\/p>\n<pre><code>$sasToken = New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken -Container abc -Permission rl\n$Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName $StorageAccountName -SasToken $sasToken<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><strong>C. Via Connectin String<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This third method uses a connection string, entered manually, which is then used to generate the context as shown below.<\/p>\n<pre><code>$ConnectionString = \"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;BlobEndpoint=&lt;blobEndpoint&gt;;QueueEndpoint=&lt;QueueEndpoint&gt;;TableEndpoint=&lt;TableEndpoint&gt;;AccountName=&lt;AccountName&gt;;AccountKey=&lt;AccountKey&gt;\"\n$Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext -ConnectionString $ConnectionString<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>2. Uploading the files using the context<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you have the context to the storage account you can upload and download files from the storage blob container.\nUse the below code to upload a file named &quot;<em>Parameters.json<\/em>&quot;, located on the local machine at &quot;<em>C:\\Temp<\/em>&quot; directory.<\/p>\n<pre><code>#Uploading File\n$BlobName = \"Parameters.json\"\n$localFile = \"C:\\Temp\\\" + $BlobName\n$ContainerName  = \"vhds\"\n\n#Note the Force switch will overwrite if the file already exists in the Azure container\nSet-AzureStorageBlobContent -File $localFile -Container $ContainerName -Blob $BlobName -Context $Ctx -Force<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>3. Downloading the files using the context<\/h3>\n<p>Download works in almost identical manner. You use the Get cmdlet instead of Set as shown below to download a file to a local folder, located at &quot;<em>C:\\Downloads<\/em>&quot;.<\/p>\n<pre><code>#Download File\n$BlobName = \"Parameters.json\"\n$localTargetDirectory = \"C:\\Downloads\"\n$ContainerName  = \"vhds\"\n\nGet-AzureStorageBlobContent -Blob $BlobName -Container $ContainerName -Destination $localTargetDirectory -Context $ctx<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>I hope this helps simplify the automated usage of Azure Storage container.

Please note that this option is not compatible with applications using partition switching and index hints. Dropping unused indexes is not supported for Premium and Business Critical service tiers.   <\/li>\n<li>Parameterize queries recommendations (preview) - Recommends forced parameterization in cases when you have one or more queries that are constantly being recompiled but end up with the same query execution plan.  <\/li>\n<li>Fix schema issues recommendations (preview) - Recommendations for schema correction appear when the SQL Database service notices an anomaly in the number of scheme-related SQL errors that are happening on your SQL database. Microsoft is currently deprecating the &quot;Fix schema issue&quot; recommendations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Automatic Tuning<\/h3>\n<img src=\"\/images\/15845063775e71a60998da5.png\" alt=\"Automatic Tuning\">\n<p>Azure SQL Database automatic tuning provides peak performance and stable workloads through continuous performance tuning based on AI and machine learning.\nAutomatic tuning is a fully managed intelligent performance service that uses built-in intelligence to continuously monitor queries executed on a database, and it automatically improves their performance. This is achieved by dynamically adapting the database to the changing workloads and applying tuning recommendations. Automatic tuning learns horizontally from all databases on Azure through AI and it dynamically improves its tuning actions. The longer a database runs with automatic tuning on, the better it performs.\nAzure SQL Database automatic tuning might be one of the most important features that you can enable to provide stable and peak performing database workloads.<\/p>\n<p>What can automatic tuning do for you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Automated performance tuning of Azure SQL databases<\/li>\n<li>Automated verification of performance gains<\/li>\n<li>Automated rollback and self-correction<\/li>\n<li>Tuning history<\/li>\n<li>Tuning action T-SQL scripts for manual deployments<\/li>\n<li>Proactive workload performance monitoring<\/li>\n<li>Scale-out capability on hundreds of thousands of databases<\/li>\n<li>The positive impact to DevOps resources and the total cost of ownership<\/li>\n<\/ul>",
