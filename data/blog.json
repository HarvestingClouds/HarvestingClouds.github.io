Parameters<\/h2>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, parameters are the way to customize the templates, each time you deploy it to create resources in Azure. These parameters are the end-user inputs for various aspects of the template. E.g. If you are deploying an Azure Virtual Machine via an ARM Template then the name of the VM can be an input parameter. Operating System type can be another parameter.<\/p>\n<p>The parameters can be referred and used in other parts of the ARM Template.<\/p>\n<h3>Defining Parameters<\/h3>\n<p>Parameters is a one huge JSON object with multiple JSON properties. Each property is one parameter which is represented as another JSON object. Let us look at it's structure at high level.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"parameters\": {\n               \"parameter 1\" : {},\n               \"parameter 2\" : {},\n               \"parameter 3\" : {}\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>E.g. If you are creating a template to deploy a Windows Virtual Machine then the parameters will look something like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"parameters\": {\n               \"VMName\" : {},\n               \"AdminUserName\" : {},\n               \"AdminPassword\" : {},\n               \"WindowsOSVersion\" : {}\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now let us look at one of the parameter. E.g. The AdminUserName parameter will look like:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"adminUsername\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"minLength\": 1,\n            \"metadata\": {\n                \"description\": \"Username for the Virtual Machine.\"\n            }\n        }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The parameter object, as shown above, has following parts:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Type<\/strong> - This is the data Type of the parameter.<\/li>\n<li><strong>minLength<\/strong> - This is the minimum lenth the parameter must have<\/li>\n<li><strong>Metadata<\/strong> - This is just to provide a description as to what the parameter means.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The <strong>Data Type<\/strong> allowed for the parameter are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>string or secureString \u2013 any valid JSON string<\/li>\n<li>int \u2013 any valid JSON integer<\/li>\n<li>bool \u2013 any valid JSON boolean <\/li>\n<li>object \u2013 any valid JSON object <\/li>\n<li>array \u2013 any valid JSON array<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A more complex parameter e.g. Windows OS Version, with few more properties, is shown below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"windowsOSVersion\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"defaultValue\": \"2012-R2-Datacenter\",\n            \"allowedValues\": [\n                \"2008-R2-SP1\",\n                \"2012-Datacenter\",\n                \"2012-R2-Datacenter\"\n            ],\n            \"metadata\": {\n                \"description\": \"The Windows version for the VM. This will pick a fully patched image of this given Windows version. Allowed values: 2008-R2-SP1, 2012-Datacenter, 2012-R2-Datacenter.\"\n            }\n        }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>It has additional below properties:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Default Value<\/strong> - <\/li>\n<li><strong>Allowed Values<\/strong> - \n<h2>2. Variables<\/h2><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>3. Resources<\/h2>\n<h2>4. Outputs<\/h2>",

			"body": "<p>Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates are written in JSON or <strong>JavaScript Object Notation<\/strong>. To understand ARM templates, you need to understand few quick basics about JSON. These will enable you to lay a great foundation which will enable you to understand ARM templates very easily.<\/p>\n<p>JSON or JavaScript Object Notation (pronounce like &quot;Jay-son&quot;) is a text-based data format that's designed to be human-readable, lightweight, and easy to transmit between a server and a web client. Its syntax is derived from JavaScript. Think of this as an even more compact version of XML files.<\/p>\n<p>JSON is a popular notation for transmitting data through RESTful web services. The official internet media type for JSON is <code>application\/json<\/code>, and JSON files typically have a <code>.json<\/code> extension.<\/p>\n<p>To understand JSON we need to understand <strong>3 main components<\/strong>. These components are like building blocks, using which you can build very complex JSON files.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Objects<\/h2>\n<p>Objects are the heart of JSON. Object denotes a real life object, e.g. an Employee. Just like a real life object, these have various properties and a value for each of these properties. E.g. An Employee will have Name property with value as John. Further, an employee object can have various another properties like Age, Salary, Department etc. So to denote an object in JSON you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One object will be represented by curly brackets. It will begin from opening curly bracket i.e. <code>{<\/code> and will end at closing curly bracket i.e. <code>}<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Denote the property and corresponding values as <code>\"key\" : \"value\"<\/code> or <code>\"property\" : \"value\"<\/code> pairs.<\/li>\n<li>You can only use double quotes for Properties as they will always be of type string<\/li>\n<li>You will have double quotes around Values if they are of string type. You will not have any quotes in case of a number or a boolean value.<\/li>\n<li>Each property will be separated from next property by a comma<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> Each JSON file is also a single JSON object. At root level it starts with an opening curly bracket i.e. <code>{<\/code> and will end with closing curly bracket i.e. <code>}<\/code>. There can't be any other objects at the root level. Think of this similar to how in an XML file there can be only one element at the root level. <\/p>\n<p>Example Employee object is shown below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"Name\" : \"John\",\n    \"Age\" : 34,\n    \"Department\" : \"Finance\",\n    \"Salary\" : \"100000\",\n    \"IsAdmin\" : true\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<h2>2. Arrays<\/h2>\n<p>Simply put, arrays are a collection of items. In JSON the <strong>square brackets<\/strong> represents an Array. E.g. An array of 3 employees will look like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>[\n  {\n        \"Name\" : \"John\",\n        \"Age\" : 34\n    },\n   {\n        \"Name\" : \"Mary\",\n        \"Age\" : 32\n    },\n   {\n        \"Name\" : \"Matthew\",\n        \"Age\" : 29\n    }\n]<\/code><\/pre>\n<h2>3. Nesting of Objects<\/h2>\n<p>Now things get more interesting with nesting of Objects. What Nesting means is that one object can have it's property as another complex object. Don't worry if that sounds confusing. Let's understand that statement using an example. An Address where a person lives can be represented by an object. This object will look like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n  \"StreetNumber\" : \"50\",\n  \"StreetName\" : \"Brian Harrison Way\",\n  \"Unit Number\" : 22,\n  \"City\" : \"Toronto\",\n  \"Country\" : \"Canada\"\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now an Employee Object will have an Address object as one of it's property (because employee need to live somewhere). This new complex Employee object will look like below, with nested Address object as one of it's property:<\/p>\n<pre><code> {\n        \"Name\" : \"John\",\n        \"Age\" : 34,\n        \"Department\" : \"Finance\",\n        \"Salary\" : \"100000\",\n        \"IsAdmin\" : true,\n        \"Address\" :   {\n                          \"StreetNumber\" : \"50\",\n                          \"StreetName\" : \"Brian Harrison Way\",\n                          \"Unit Number\" : 22,\n                          \"City\" : \"Toronto\",\n                          \"Country\" : \"Canada\"\n                       }\n    }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>That's all there is to it. Now you can use these 3 components and build very complex json files\/templates. Even the most complex template can be broken into these 3 components. <\/p>\n<p>Below is a complex example with all 3 components. <\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"Department\": \"Finance\",\n    \"TotalEmployees\": 2,\n    \"Employees\": [\n        {\n            \"Name\": \"John\",\n            \"Age\": 34,\n            \"Department\": \"Finance\",\n            \"Salary\": \"100000\",\n            \"IsAdmin\": true,\n            \"Address\": {\n                \"StreetNumber\": \"50\",\n                \"StreetName\": \"Brian Harrison Way\",\n                \"Unit Number\": 22,\n                \"City\": \"Toronto\",\n                \"Country\": \"Canada\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"Name\": \"John\",\n            \"Age\": 34,\n            \"Department\": \"Finance\",\n            \"Salary\": \"100000\",\n            \"IsAdmin\": true,\n            \"Address\": {\n                \"StreetNumber\": \"50\",\n                \"StreetName\": \"Brian Harrison Way\",\n                \"Unit Number\": 22,\n                \"City\": \"Toronto\",\n                \"Country\": \"Canada\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The above JSON object denotes one department with name as Finance and total number of employees as 2. Then the &quot;Employees&quot; object is an array of 2 emplyees. Each emplyee object further have a complex property as Address, which is another object. <\/p>\n<p>If you understood each of the 3 components, you should be able to build\/understand most complex JSON files with ease.<\/p>",

			"body": "<p><strong>Azure blob storage<\/strong> can provide a very highly available way to store your files in the cloud. You can dynamically add or remove the files in an automated fashion. These files can then be used for any number of purposes. E.g. A parameter file for ARM template can be kept in Azure blob storage and then dynamically read while creating resources from an ARM template.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The whole process can be broken down into 3 parts<\/strong>:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Generating the context to the storage container<\/li>\n<li>Uploading the files using the context<\/li>\n<li>Downloading the files using the context<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h3>1. Generating the context to the storage container<\/h3>\n<p>The context to the storage blob container can be created in one of the 3 ways, based on your security requirements. All methods use the <code>New-AzureStorageContext<\/code> cmdlet to generate the storage context. The methods differ on how you pass the parameters to this cmdlet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A. Via fetching the Azure Storage Key<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This first method uses the <code>Get-AzureStorageKey<\/code> to fetch the storage key. This key is then used to generate the context as shown below.<\/p>\n<pre><code>$StorageAccountName = \"yourstorageaccount\"\n$StorageAccountKey = Get-AzureStorageKey -StorageAccountName $StorageAccountName\n$Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext $StorageAccountName -StorageAccountKey $StorageAccountKey.Primary<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><strong>B. Via fetching the Azure Storage Container SAS Token<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This second method uses the <code>New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken<\/code> to create a new SAS token to securely access the storage container. This token is then used to generate the context as shown below.<\/p>\n<pre><code>$sasToken = New-AzureStorageContainerSASToken -Container abc -Permission rl\n$Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext -StorageAccountName $StorageAccountName -SasToken $sasToken<\/code><\/pre>\n<p><strong>C. Via Connectin String<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This third method uses a connection string, entered manually, which is then used to generate the context as shown below.<\/p>\n<pre><code>$ConnectionString = \"DefaultEndpointsProtocol=http;BlobEndpoint=&lt;blobEndpoint&gt;;QueueEndpoint=&lt;QueueEndpoint&gt;;TableEndpoint=&lt;TableEndpoint&gt;;AccountName=&lt;AccountName&gt;;AccountKey=&lt;AccountKey&gt;\"\n$Ctx = New-AzureStorageContext -ConnectionString $ConnectionString<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>2. Uploading the files using the context<\/h3>\n<p>Now that you have the context to the storage account you can upload and download files from the storage blob container.\nUse the below code to upload a file named &quot;<em>Parameters.json<\/em>&quot;, located on the local machine at &quot;<em>C:\\Temp<\/em>&quot; directory.<\/p>\n<pre><code>#Uploading File\n$BlobName = \"Parameters.json\"\n$localFile = \"C:\\Temp\\\" + $BlobName\n\n#Note the Force switch will overwrite if the file already exists in the Azure container\nSet-AzureStorageBlobContent -File $localFile -Container $ContainerName -Blob $BlobName -Context $Ctx -Force<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>3. Downloading the files using the context<\/h3>\n<p>Download works in almost identical manner. You use the Get cmdlet instead of Set as shown below to download a file to a local folder, located at &quot;<em>C:\\Downloads<\/em>&quot;.<\/p>\n<pre><code>#Download File\n$BlobName = \"Parameters.json\"\n$localTargetDirectory = \"C:\\Downloads\"\n\nGet-AzureStorageBlobContent -Blob $BlobName -Container $ContainerName -Destination $localTargetDirectory -Context $ctx<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>I hope this helps simplify the automated usage of Azure Storage container.

Parameters<\/h2>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, parameters are the way to customize the templates, each time you deploy it to create resources in Azure. These parameters are the end-user inputs for various aspects of the template. E.g. If you are deploying an Azure Virtual Machine via an ARM Template then the name of the VM can be an input parameter. Operating System type can be another parameter.<\/p>\n<p>The parameters can be referred and used in other parts of the ARM Template.<\/p>\n<h3>Defining Parameters<\/h3>\n<p>Parameters is a one huge JSON object with multiple JSON properties. Each property is one parameter which is represented as another JSON object. Let us look at it's structure at high level.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"parameters\": {\n               \"parameter 1\" : {},\n               \"parameter 2\" : {},\n               \"parameter 3\" : {}\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>E.g. If you are creating a template to deploy a Windows Virtual Machine then the parameters will look something like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"parameters\": {\n               \"VMName\" : {},\n               \"AdminUserName\" : {},\n               \"AdminPassword\" : {},\n               \"WindowsOSVersion\" : {}\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now let us look at one of the parameter. E.g. The AdminUserName parameter will look like:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"adminUsername\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"minLength\": 1,\n            \"metadata\": {\n                \"description\": \"Username for the Virtual Machine.\"\n            }\n        }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The parameter object, as shown above, has following parts:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Type<\/strong> - This is the data Type of the parameter.<\/li>\n<li><strong>minLength<\/strong> - This is the minimum lenth the parameter must have<\/li>\n<li><strong>Metadata<\/strong> - This is just to provide a description as to what the parameter means.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The <strong>Data Type<\/strong> allowed for the parameter are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>string or secureString \u2013 any valid JSON string<\/li>\n<li>int \u2013 any valid JSON integer<\/li>\n<li>bool \u2013 any valid JSON boolean <\/li>\n<li>object \u2013 any valid JSON object <\/li>\n<li>array \u2013 any valid JSON array<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A more complex parameter e.g. Windows OS Version, with few more properties, is shown below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"windowsOSVersion\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"defaultValue\": \"2012-R2-Datacenter\",\n            \"allowedValues\": [\n                \"2008-R2-SP1\",\n                \"2012-Datacenter\",\n                \"2012-R2-Datacenter\"\n            ],\n            \"metadata\": {\n                \"description\": \"The Windows version for the VM. This will pick a fully patched image of this given Windows version. Allowed values: 2008-R2-SP1, 2012-Datacenter, 2012-R2-Datacenter.\"\n            }\n        }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>It has additional below properties:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Default Value<\/strong> - <\/li>\n<li><strong>Allowed Values<\/strong> - \n<h2>2.

			"body": "<p>Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates are written in JSON or <strong>JavaScript Object Notation<\/strong>. To understand ARM templates, you need to understand few quick basics about JSON. These will enable you to lay a great foundation which will enable you to understand ARM templates very easily.<\/p>\n<p>JSON or JavaScript Object Notation (pronounce like &quot;Jay-son&quot;) is a text-based data format that's designed to be human-readable, lightweight, and easy to transmit between a server and a web client. Its syntax is derived from JavaScript. Think of this as an even more compact version of XML files.<\/p>\n<p>JSON is a popular notation for transmitting data through RESTful web services. The official internet media type for JSON is <code>application\/json<\/code>, and JSON files typically have a <code>.json<\/code> extension.<\/p>\n<p>To understand JSON we need to understand <strong>3 main components<\/strong>. These components are like building blocks, using which you can build very complex JSON files.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Objects<\/h2>\n<p>Objects are the heart of JSON. Object denotes a real life object, e.g. an Employee. Just like a real life object, these have various properties and a value for each of these properties. E.g. An Employee will have Name property with value as John. Further, an employee object can have various another properties like Age, Salary, Department etc. So to denote an object in JSON you:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>One object will be represented by curly brackets. It will begin from opening curly bracket i.e. <code>{<\/code> and will end at closing curly bracket i.e. <code>}<\/code><\/li>\n<li>Denote the property and corresponding values as <code>\"key\" : \"value\"<\/code> or <code>\"property\" : \"value\"<\/code> pairs.<\/li>\n<li>You can only use double quotes for Properties as they will always be of type string<\/li>\n<li>You will have double quotes around Values if they are of string type. You will not have any quotes in case of a number or a boolean value.<\/li>\n<li>Each property will be separated from next property by a comma<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> Each JSON file is also a single JSON object. At root level it starts with an opening curly bracket i.e. <code>{<\/code> and will end with closing curly bracket i.e. <code>}<\/code>. There can't be any other objects at the root level. Think of this similar to how in an XML file there can be only one element at the root level. <\/p>\n<p>Example Employee object is shown below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"Name\" : \"John\",\n    \"Age\" : 34,\n    \"Department\" : \"Finance\",\n    \"Salary\" : \"100000\",\n    \"IsAdmin\" : true\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<h2>2. Arrays<\/h2>\n<p>Simply put, arrays are a collection of items. In JSON the <strong>square brackets<\/strong> represents an Array. E.g. An array of 3 employees will look like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>[\n  {\n        \"Name\" : \"John\",\n        \"Age\" : 34\n    },\n   {\n        \"Name\" : \"Mary\",\n        \"Age\" : 32\n    },\n   {\n        \"Name\" : \"Matthew\",\n        \"Age\" : 29\n    }\n]<\/code><\/pre>\n<h2>3. Nesting of Objects<\/h2>\n<p>Now things get more interesting with nesting of Objects. What Nesting means is that one object can have it's property as another complex object. Don't worry if that sounds confusing. Let's understand that statement using an example. An Address where a person lives can be represented by an object. This object will look like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n  \"StreetNumber\" : \"50\",\n  \"StreetName\" : \"Brian Harrison Way\",\n  \"Unit Number\" : 22,\n  \"City\" : \"Toronto\",\n  \"Country\" : \"Canada\"\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now an Employee Object will have an Address object as one of it's property (because employee need to live somewhere). This new complex Employee object will look like below, with nested Address object as one of it's property:<\/p>\n<pre><code> {\n        \"Name\" : \"John\",\n        \"Age\" : 34,\n        \"Department\" : \"Finance\",\n        \"Salary\" : \"100000\",\n        \"IsAdmin\" : true,\n        \"Address\" :   {\n                          \"StreetNumber\" : \"50\",\n                          \"StreetName\" : \"Brian Harrison Way\",\n                          \"Unit Number\" : 22,\n                          \"City\" : \"Toronto\",\n                          \"Country\" : \"Canada\"\n                       }\n    }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>That's all there is to it. Now you can use these 3 components and build very complex json files\/templates. Even the most complex template can be broken into these 3 components. <\/p>\n<p>Below is a complex example with all 3 components. <\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"Department\": \"Finance\",\n    \"TotalEmployees\": 2,\n    \"Employees\": [\n        {\n            \"Name\": \"John\",\n            \"Age\": 34,\n            \"Department\": \"Finance\",\n            \"Salary\": \"100000\",\n            \"IsAdmin\": true,\n            \"Address\": {\n                \"StreetNumber\": \"50\",\n                \"StreetName\": \"Brian Harrison Way\",\n                \"Unit Number\": 22,\n                \"City\": \"Toronto\",\n                \"Country\": \"Canada\"\n            }\n        },\n        {\n            \"Name\": \"John\",\n            \"Age\": 34,\n            \"Department\": \"Finance\",\n            \"Salary\": \"100000\",\n            \"IsAdmin\": true,\n            \"Address\": {\n                \"StreetNumber\": \"50\",\n                \"StreetName\": \"Brian Harrison Way\",\n                \"Unit Number\": 22,\n                \"City\": \"Toronto\",\n                \"Country\": \"Canada\"\n            }\n        }\n    ]\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The above JSON object denotes one department with name as Finance and total number of employees as 2. Then the &quot;Employees&quot; object is an array of 2 emplyees. Each emplyee object further have a complex property as Address, which is another object. <\/p>\n<p>If you understood each of the 3 components, you should be able to build\/understand most complex JSON files with ease.<\/p>",

The environment was managed by Third Party who did not want to give any service account for VMWare as their environment was shared with different customers. So we had access only to the VMs. Without relevant access, ASR for VMWare was out of the question for us.<\/p>\n<h3>Solution<\/h3>\n<p>We treated the VMs, in such environment, as physical machines when setting up ASR to replicate these machines to Azure.\nWe used the option of &quot;<strong><em>Not virtualized\/other<\/em><\/strong>&quot; in the &quot;<strong><em>Prepare Infrastructure<\/em><\/strong>&quot; wizard of ASR. We <strong>treated the VMs as physical servers<\/strong> and did not face any issues during the migration. <\/p>\n<p>Refer below screenshot for the exact option discussed above.<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/14696297155798c513ea908.png\" alt=\"Protection Goal\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Later when enabling the Replication for any Server, run the &quot;<strong><em>Enable Replication<\/em><\/strong>&quot; wizard by clicking on &quot;<strong>+Replicate<\/strong>&quot; on the ASR vault's blade. Then select &quot;<strong>Machine Type<\/strong>&quot; as &quot;<strong><em>Physical Machine<\/em><\/strong>&quot; and add the Physical Machines by mentioning their IP addresses. <\/p>\n<p><strong>Note:<\/strong> For this approach to work, the Configuration server should be on the same network as the VM being considered as Physical Machine.<\/p>\n<p>We were able to migrate many servers successfully and without any issues using this approach.<\/p>",

It also defines the dependencies between the deployed resources.<\/p>\n<p>In this post, we will deconstruct any basic ARM template and will understand it's various components.<\/p>\n<p>Any ARM Template will look like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>{\n    \"$schema\": \"https:\/\/schema.management.azure.com\/schemas\/2015-01-01\/deploymentTemplate.json#\",\n    \"contentVersion\": \"1.0.0.0\",\n    \"parameters\": {},\n    \"variables\": {},\n    \"resources\": [ {}, {} ]\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Snapshot of the Template at root level, as generated via Visual Studio:<\/p>\n<p><img src=\"http:\/\/HarvestingClouds.com\/images\/147520488857edd71873f9b.png\" alt=\"ARM Template Components\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see the components (or properties) of any ARM template includes:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Schema<\/li>\n<li>Content Version<\/li>\n<li>Parameters<\/li>\n<li>Variables<\/li>\n<li>Resources<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Let's look at these in more detail.<\/p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"4\">\n        <colgroup>\n            <col>\n            <col>\n            <col>\n            <col>\n        <\/colgroup>\n        <tbody valign=\"top\">\n            <tr>\n                <th>Element name<\/th>\n                <th>Required<\/th>\n                <th>JSON Type<\/th>\n                <th>Description<\/th>\n            <\/tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>$schema<\/td>\n                <td>Yes<\/td>\n                <td>String Value<\/td>\n                <td>Location of the JSON schema file that describes the version of the template language.<\/td>\n            <\/tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td>contentVersion<\/td>\n                <td>Yes<\/td>\n                <td>String Value<\/td>\n                <td>Version of the template (such as 1.2.0.20).

Parameters<\/h2>\n<p>As mentioned earlier, parameters are the way to customize the templates, each time you deploy it to create resources in Azure. These parameters are the end-user inputs for various aspects of the template. E.g. If you are deploying an Azure Virtual Machine via an ARM Template then the name of the VM can be an input parameter. Operating System type can be another parameter.<\/p>\n<p>The parameters can be referred and used in other parts of the ARM Template.<\/p>\n<h3>Defining Parameters<\/h3>\n<p>Parameters is a one huge JSON object with multiple JSON properties. Each property is one parameter which is represented as another JSON object. Let us look at it's structure at high level.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"parameters\": {\n               \"parameter 1\" : {},\n               \"parameter 2\" : {},\n               \"parameter 3\" : {}\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>E.g. If you are creating a template to deploy a Windows Virtual Machine then the parameters will look something like below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"parameters\": {\n               \"VMName\" : {},\n               \"AdminUserName\" : {},\n               \"AdminPassword\" : {},\n               \"WindowsOSVersion\" : {}\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Now let us look at one of the parameter. E.g. The AdminUserName parameter will look like:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"adminUsername\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"minLength\": 1,\n            \"metadata\": {\n                \"description\": \"Username for the Virtual Machine.\"\n            }\n        }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The parameter object, as shown above, has following parts:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Type<\/strong> - This is the data Type of the parameter.<\/li>\n<li><strong>minLength<\/strong> - This is the minimum lenth the parameter must have<\/li>\n<li><strong>Metadata<\/strong> - This is just to provide a description as to what the parameter means.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The <strong>Data Type<\/strong> allowed for the parameter are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>string or secureString \u2013 any valid JSON string<\/li>\n<li>int \u2013 any valid JSON integer<\/li>\n<li>bool \u2013 any valid JSON boolean <\/li>\n<li>object \u2013 any valid JSON object <\/li>\n<li>array \u2013 any valid JSON array<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A more complex parameter e.g. Windows OS Version, with few more properties, is shown below:<\/p>\n<pre><code>\"windowsOSVersion\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"defaultValue\": \"2012-R2-Datacenter\",\n            \"allowedValues\": [\n                \"2008-R2-SP1\",\n                \"2012-Datacenter\",\n                \"2012-R2-Datacenter\"\n            ],\n            \"metadata\": {\n                \"description\": \"The Windows version for the VM. This will pick a fully patched image of this given Windows version. Allowed values: 2008-R2-SP1, 2012-Datacenter, 2012-R2-Datacenter.\"\n            }\n        }<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>It has additional below properties:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Default Value<\/strong> - <\/li>\n<li><strong>Allowed Values<\/strong> - \n<h2>2.
